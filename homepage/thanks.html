    regularly participate in the Google Summer of Code program.  Through
    haskell.org, the Darcs Team was able to work on two summer of code
    projects in 2007 and 2009.  This work allowed us to make progress on
    the Darcs 2 formalism and optimisations to the Darcs repository
    format.  We are grateful to both Google and Haskell.org for this
    great opportunity to improve Darcs.
