# Patch theory in the past/present/future

## Past: Darcs 1 - Mergers

- An explanation of [mergers](http://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/darcs-devel/2005-May/002400.html)
  (and what conflictors were meant to be)
- [Merges Documentation](Theory/MergersDocumentation) An old theory document that was included in the darcs source, from around when mergers were in use. Explains unwinding and mergers to some extent.

## Present: Darcs 2 - Conflictors

- [Conflictors](Theory/Conflictors): the current state of the art

## Future? Darcs 3 - ?

Ian and Ganesh want a minimal 'toy' implementation of the core patch theory
stuff (which could eventually be plugged into darcs 3). The point is to prove
things about patch theory. One it would make everybody feel a lot better, two
we could then do things like simplify it whilst proving that things *still*
work. With that in mind:

- [Camp](http://projects.haskell.org/camp/) is a project to develop and prove
    correct a darcs-like patch theory, which will hopefully form the basis for
    darcs 3. The theory is similar to that of darcs 2, so reading the paper on
    the camp site will also give an insight into how the current darcs patch
    theory works.
- Judah Jacobson wrote up his work on formalizing darcs 2-and-beyond patch theory
  on <ftp://ftp.math.ucla.edu/pub/camreport/cam09-83.pdf>
- [Graphictors](Ideas/Graphictors) are an evolution of Conflictors.
