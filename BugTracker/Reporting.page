title: Reporting Bugs in Darcs
...

# Basics

To report a bug in Darcs, just send an email to
[bugs@darcs.net](mailto:bugs@darcs.net) describing the problem. It will
appear as an unread bug on
[http://bugs.darcs.net/](http://bugs.darcs.net/).

If you have never reported a Darcs bug before, your message will be held
in a quarantine area until a human confirms that it's not spam. But this
is only for the first time; future bug reports from you will go
automatically to our tracker.

# Advanced bug-reporting-fu

We appreciate the feedback or bug reports that you send us, thanks! Got
a little extra energy to make things easier on us? Here's the sort of
thing we love to see.

1.  A concise subject that expresses the issue:

    -   :-( - bug report (*too vague*)
    -   :-) - darcs clone doesn't work over sshfs (*better*)

2.  The exact Darcs version (darcs --exact-version)

3.  Platform information (what OS, usually)

4.  Simple reproduction steps (ideally, a block of commands that we can
    copy and paste into a terminal)

5.  A Darcs repository URL, and or if you have a broken repository,
    download links for tarballs or zip files.
