# Priorities

The priority value of an issue summarizes the importance of the issue,
as seen by the darcs team. The importance of the issue, as seen by the
reporter of the issue, must be apparent from the messages of the issue.

The actual priority values that can be used at any time can be extracted
from the bug tracker itself:
[http://bugs.darcs.net/priority](http://bugs.darcs.net/priority) . The
priority values are described in the following table, mostly taken from
[http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-1.0/user\_guide.html](http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-1.0/user_guide.html)
.

-   `critical` - Makes Darcs unusable or mostly so, or causes data loss,
    or introduces a security hole.
-   `urgent` - Major effect on the usability of a package, without
    rendering it completely unusable to everyone.
-   `bug` - The default value, applicable to most bugs.
-   `feature` - Feature requests (let's do this!)
-   `wishlist` - Lower priority feature requests (patches welcome!).
-   `invalid` - Spam, noise, etc
-   `not-our-bug` - The issue cannot be resolved within darcs itself

# Status

The status value of an issue in the bug tracker summarizes the status of
the issue. The actual status values that can be used at any time can be
extracted from the bug tracker itself:
[http://bugs.darcs.net/status](http://bugs.darcs.net/status). The use
and interpretation of status values are described in the following
table.

-   `unknown` - Bugs with this status should be considered as needing
    customer service and/or triage.
-   `waiting-for` - Need details from the original reporter; need a
    dependency fulfilled
-   `needs-reproduction` - Can anybody else reproduce the symptoms?
-   `needs-testcase` - Now that we can reproduce it, can we distill it
    into a formal test?
-   `needs-diagnosis/design` - We have all the information we need, now
    need to think about something in particular
-   `needs-implementation` - ready to hack!
-   `in-progress` - Work is in progress to solve the problem described
    by the issue. Assigned to person working on it.
-   `deferred` - We just cannot deal with this bug right now and have to
    retarget it for the far future. To be used sparingly.
-   `duplicate` - The issue is a duplicate of another issue. Don't
    forget to point to old bug using superseder
-   `wont-fix` - Sorry.
-   `given-up` - An issue which cannot be reproduced or with questions
    left unanswered for a long time.
-   `resolved` - The issue has been resolved. The state of the issue and
    reason for considering the issue resolved must be described in
    messages of the issue.
