(For BTS admins)

Bugtracker down? Patches dropped?

Things to keep in mind:

* MX records => osuosl.org
   
    - so mail goes there first before being forwarded to darcsvm
    - darcs-{users,devel} should never touch darcsvm (except to user-name-here@darcs.net)

# Things to try

1. Is the mail server still running?
