the first time you do this
--------------------------
1. cabal install pandoc xml
   ghc --make parsechanges.hs -package pandoc -package xml

2. darcs changes --repo http://darcs.net\
                  --match 'date "1 week ago"'\
                  | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 \
                  | sed -e 's/^  \* //'\
                  > lastchange

collecting news items
---------------------
One option is to use the darcs repository, start writing your
../yyyy-mm-dd.page as you see items.  If you are working in more than
one location, the slight disadvantage is that you have to actually
remember to darcs record and darcs push. (or just accept to have
conflicts, which are clearly not a big deal here)

Another option (if you are using a mail client with some notion of tags
or labels) is to tag notable messages with 'dwn', so that you can just
review them and go...

creating a news entry
---------------------
1. ./createstub.sh >> ../yyyy-mm-dd.page

2. (visit <http://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/darcs-users/>)
   (write up ../yyyy-mm-dd.page)

3. darcs add    ../yyyy-mm-dd.age
   darcs record
   darcs push

4. (request comments and make modifications)

5. darcs record
   darcs push

6. ./changestoblog.sh ../yyyy-mm-dd.page

7. (Fix the html, like changing the <h1> into <h3> and editing out the patches.)

8. (paste into blogspot... do not be alarmed by weirdness (yet).
    toggle back and forth between compose/view mode until it looks
    right)
