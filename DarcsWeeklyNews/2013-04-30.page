# News and discussions

1.  Darcs will be participating to this year's Google Summer of Code under
    the umbrella of Haskell.org! If you are interested please consult the ideas
    page and contact us:

    -   <http://darcs.net/GSoC>

2.  Sebastian Fischer implemented `darcs-history`, a program to be used as
    darcs posthook and that tracks patch movements inside of a repository:

    -   <http://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/darcs-devel/2013-February/014898.html>
    -   <http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sebf/darcs/darcs-history/README.html>

3.  Sebastian also suggested the possibility for darcs to easily split and
    merge patches that are depended upon:

4.  Piyush P Kurur was also interested in some special kinds of deep
    `amend-record`:
