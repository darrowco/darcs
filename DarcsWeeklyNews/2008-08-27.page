Hi everybody,

I thought it would be useful if we got back into the habit up
summarising our weekly darcs activities. This is the first entry of what
I hope to be Darcs Weekly News.

# News and discussions

  ~ Simplify filepath handling, cutting lots of hardly-used code. don't

    fix fix\_filepath to work with --repodir (and add test demonstrating
    this). eliminate fix\_flag. add new framework for ensuring that
    certain arguments are converted to absolute paths. make Darcs.Lock
    functions accept FilePathLike arguments. refactor maybeMkSubPath
    very slightly. refactor repoPath very slightly. make makeAbsolute
    behavior match comment.
