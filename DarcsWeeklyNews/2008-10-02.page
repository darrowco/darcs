# News and discussions

1.  Third pre-release of darcs 2.1.0. Release pushed back to 17 October
    latest for more testing. We're getting very close to the finish
    line!

2.  Darcs ideas in other VCS. Kirill Smelkov has kind words for us on
    behalf of the NAVY project, which is moving away from darcs. Best of
    luck to Kirill with whatever revision control system NAVY choose!
    While we are delighted that "Good ideas behind [darcs] were adopted
    by youth", we still have a thing or two to show these
    whippersnappers.

3.  Haddock + Hoogle == Javadoc on steroids. Simon Michael has combined
    haddock and hoogle to give us a lovely darcs code browser. In the
    meantime, Florent Becker has been adding value to this browser by
    sending in lots of haddock patches. Many thanks to Simon and
    Florent!

4.  Patch theory update. Ian gives us his latest progress on
    documenting, prototyping and improving darcs patch theory. "[S]ome
    proofs are finally starting to appear, albeit rather handwavey for
    now". Go Ian!
