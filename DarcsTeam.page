Like many free and open source projects, darcs is running on spare time
and pure enthusiasm. We need your help! Here are the roles which we are
currently filling and that we would like to fill.

# Core team

We hope to grow the core team over time. Members of the team will be
asked to review patches on a regular basis and to push them into
mainline Darcs as they see fit.

Interested in joining? It's the best way to get to know the Darcs code.
Subscribe to darcs-users and start reviewing some patches today. We'll
be sure to notice! After some point, we'll invite you on board, after
having started a discussion and building up a consensus among current
team members.

# Oversight Committee

Slightly edited (bullet points) from the Software Freedom Conservancy
[agreement](http://darcs.net/darcs-sponsorship-agreement.pdf):

The Oversight Committee, initially composed of

-   Tommy Pettersson,
-   Ian Lynagh,
-   Ganesh Sittampalam,
-   Mark Stosberg and
-   Zooko Wilcox O'Hearn,

shall represent the Project in its official communication with the
Conservancy. Members of the Oversight Committee may be added or removed
from the Committee at any time by a majority vote of all of the members
of the Oversight Committee. The Oversight Committee will elect a single
individual to communicate with the Conservancy (the "Representative")
and shall notify the Conservancy promptly following the election of a
new Representative. The Representative will have the authority to
instruct the Conservancy on the Project's behalf on all matters. This
section may be modified by a vote of at least 3/4 of all of the members
of the Oversight Committee, with the consent of the Conservancy, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

**Commentary**: Technically speaking, the Oversight Committee and
Representative language only really concerns our relationship with the
SFC; but in practice, we also use this as part of our project
governance. So how does this work in practice? The Oversight Committee
are not necessarily involved in day-to-day governance of the Darcs
project (though its members may be). They delegate this job to a
Benevolent-Dictator-esque figure (currently Guillaume Hoffmann). Their role is
basically to act as a safety mechanism, allowing for an orderly change
in leadership should the need arise.
