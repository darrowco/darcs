This is meant as a temporary page for the darcs application to be a
Google Summer of Code mentoring organisation, due 2009-03-09

* * * * *

1.  Describe your organization.

    -   Darcs is a free, open source distributed revision control
        system. It is based on an advanced 'theory of patches' and is
        written in Haskell.
    -   The darcs team supports the continued development of darcs by
        hosting the official darcs repository, website and bugtracker;
        and by organising regular darcs coding sprints, performing
        fundraising and otherwise seeking ways to increase the
        participation of darcs users in development.

2.  Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2009? What
    do you hope to gain by participating?

    -   More time to hack on darcs!
    -   We love darcs. We think it is unique in the revision control
        world because it uses the full patch history to get operations
        like merging and partial undos exactly right. But we also know
        that it has a lot of warts: the "patch theory" is still a work
        in progress, it has not yet been optimised to deal with large
        repositories, and it's still a little behind in GUIs and web
        interfaces.
    -   These are things that that take a lot of time and concerted
        effort to work on, which is why we're so excited by the
        opportunity that a GSoC project would provide. Our goal is to
        create as much space as possible for us to work on darcs, for
        example, by getting "20% time" arrangements with our employers,
        holding biannual darcs hacking sprints, cooperating with
        lecturers to develop student projects, and actively
        participating in programs like Google Summer of Code. In the
        bigger picture, we hope that the darcs project can be a regular
        participant in the Google Summer of Code program.

3.  Did your organization participate in past GSoCs? If so, please
    summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your
    participation.
4.  No. But we have had a successful project under the umbrella of the
    Haskell.org, Jason Dagit, 2007 mentored by David Roundy.

5.  Being part of the Haskell community has been very good for darcs. We
    can think of Haskell.org as a sort of incubator for projects: the
    community has given us ideas, advice and programmers. But by now, we
    have grown to the point, where it would make sense for us to stand
    our own, and for the Haskell community to concentrate on its smaller
    projects.

6.  Jason has stayed with the darcs community for a year since his
    Summer of Code project and has gone on to do a Masters thesis with
    David Roundy based on his work. Unfortunately, he has recently had
    to cut back on his darcs activity, but we will still be in touch
    with him for advice on future projects.

His work provided us with a much needed false start. As most of his time
was spent getting to grips with the darcs patch theory and learning
about the deeper parts of the code, we did not get as much
implementation work done as we would have liked. But we did a good
foundational piece of code started (the use of type witnesses), and some
preliminary work on darcs-2. While we did not end up using the latter
code, it did help us to get a better idea on how darcs-2 should work,
which allowed us to eventually release darcs 2 in January 2008.

Furthermore, we now have a somewhat better idea what kind of work is
suitable and realistic for the summer. With his advice, we will be more
careful to make sure that projects are better defined and easier to get
started on right away.

4.  If your organization has not previously participated in GSoC, have
    you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?
5.  No

6.  What license(s) does your project use?

    The GPL. We are also interested in spinning out or rewriting some of
    our our code as standalone libraries, for which we may decide that
    the BSD license is most appropriate.

7.  What is the URL for your ideas page?
    [http://wiki.darcs.net/index.html/GoogleSummerOfCode](http://wiki.darcs.net/index.html/GoogleSummerOfCode)

8.  What is the main development mailing list or forum for your
    organization?

    -   [darcs-users@darcs.net](mailto:darcs-users@darcs.net)
    -   [http://lists.osuosl.org/mailman/listinfo/darcs-users](http://lists.osuosl.org/mailman/listinfo/darcs-users)

9.  What is the main IRC channel for your organization? \#darcs on
    irc.freenode.net

10. Does your organization have an application template you would like
    to see students use? If so, please provide it now. We will use the
    same template as the Haskell community
    [http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/wiki/StudApply2008](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/wiki/StudApply2008)

11. Who will be your backup organization administrator? Please include
    Google Account information. Ganesh Sittampalam

12. Who will your mentors be? Please include Google Account information.
13. Eric KOW - eric.kow
14. Ganesh SITTAMPALAM - ganesh.sittampalam
15. Ian LYNAGH igloo earth.li
16. KIDO Takahiro - shelarcy

17. What criteria did you use to select these individuals as mentors?
    Please be as specific as possible.
18. Eric is the darcs project maintainer and has time specifically set
    aside in his week for working on darcs. Ganesh and Ian are very
    experienced Haskell programmers, and have made substantial
    contributions to darcs and darcs theory. Takahiro is an active
    member of the wxHaskell team and would be extremely helpful for any
    projects that involve build a darcs graphical user interface.

19. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?
20. We will work the same way as the Haskell community. We will choose
    students who are reliable in the first place. Also, we will expect
    our students to produce a weekly progress report, chasing after a
    week and dropping them after two weeks.
21. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?
22. Each project will have a backup mentor. If this is not enough, we
    will call on the wider darcs and Haskell community
23. What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your
    project's community before, during and after the program?
24. Before - if they aren't already regulars, we will invite our
    students to hang out in \#darcs where they can interact with the
    community and get a guided tour of the source code.
25. During - we will encourage them to blog their progress (which will
    appear on [http://planet.darcs.net)](http://planet.darcs.net)).
    Also, our Darcs Weekly News editor will keep in touch with them and
    produce regular summaries of their work.
26. After - patches which are related to the student's work would
    definitely go their way. We'll also work on making them part of the
    darcs team, as below.
27. What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with
    the project after GSoC concludes?
28. The satisfaction of your getting your code in darcs, something that
    real people rely on is quite addictive. It's how some of us got
    started anyway. We will also engage the students more actively by
    inviting them to our darcs hacking sprints (and helping to pay for
    their travel if we have the funds). We will also try to involve them
    in darcs team jobs. For example, we have a Review Team which we rely
    on to check all our incoming code. Students would be encouraged to
    participate in this team.
