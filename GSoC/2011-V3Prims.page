    it's been testsuite work up till here, in a somewhat disappointing
    tempo and not very motivated either

    I'll aim at writing usable Arbitrary instances today, so I can move
    on with actual implementation next week

    I have one last exam in this week, although that shouldn't be a real
    problem; I'll implement \*Hunk, Manifest and Move patches with
    commute and apply.

    Implement PatchMonad and move the V3 implementation inside, probably
    using a wrapper (runPatchMonad or such) to implement the "normal"
    Prim interface.

    This should more or less cover the basic objectives set out in the
    proposal, without any of the optional stuff. The optionals can come
    in after midterms.
