# Availability

-   2.8.5 is available by `cabal install darcs-2.8.5`; you can also download the [source
    tarball](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/darcs/2.8.5/darcs-2.8.5.tar.gz)
    .


# Supported GHC versions and Unicode filenames

Due to changes in ghc's handling of non-ASCII filenames, darcs 2.8.5 supports GHC versions 6.10.x, 6.12.x, 7.0.x, 7.4.x, 7.6.x and 7.8.x. Version 7.2.x is also supported on Windows. On Unix systems, version 7.2.x is disabled by the cabal file, as using a darcs executable built using ghc 7.2.x could make the on-disk format of repositories inconsistent.

# What's in 2.8


Since darcs 2.5 has been tagged, there have been 1181 patches accepted. Here is a list of the most user-visible changes:

## Performance

-   "darcs annotate" is now significantly faster and uses less
    memory, although it still slows down linearly with repository
    size.
-   An experimental option is available to speed up HTTP
    downloads.
    -   You can now use "darcs optimize --http" to create a
        repo optimized for HTTP downloads, and use "darcs get
        --packs" to download such a repo.
    -   There are still some known issues with it, so the
        feature is not enabled by default.

## New features

- Darcs now supports multiple email addresses for the author in
    the global prefs file. So, if you use different identities for
    home and work, you can now easily select between them.
    (issue1530)
-   The -o/-O options for obliterate which were removed in 2.5 are
    back.
-   Hunk-splitting now works in "darcs revert" (issue114)
-   Sending patches by email is now more robust and human
    friendly. We display a cleaner version in plain text for
    humans, and have added a complete version of the patch for
    "darcs apply". (issue1350)
-   A new environment variable has been added to help control
    network connections: DARCS\_CONNECTION\_TIMEOUT. See the
    manual for details.
-   "darcs status" has been added as a hidden alias for "darcs
    whatnew -ls" to ease the transition from some other source
    control systems. (issue182)
-   "darcs amend-record" now has the option --unrecord to allow
    individual changes to be unrecorded. (issue1470). This can
o be used as "darcs amend-unrecord".
-   "darcs amend-record"'s interactive selection now supports 'k'
    for going back to a previous patch.
-   "darcs dist" now has the option --set-scripts-executable.
    (issue734)
-   pushing to ssh:// URLS is now supported. eg: darcs push
    ssh://code.haskell.org/foo
-   If a test fails during darcs record, you now have the option
    to record it anyway. (issue332)
-   "darcs send" now tries to report the right character set in
    the email headers, and has the option --charset to override
    this.
-   "darcs init" and "darcs get" now have a --no-working-dir
    option.
-   Conflicts are now marked with red in the terminal. (issue1681)
-   ssh stderr output is now passed through, making it easier to
    diagnose problems. (issue845)
-   Interactive selection now has a 'g' command to go to the first
    patch.
-   The --unified flag is now available for record, end-record,
    revert and unrevert (issue1166)
-   darcs now has a "darcs test" command for running whatever
    test-suite is associated with the repository.

## Simplifications

-   Local support for the legacy "old-fashioned" repository format
    has been removed.
    -   You can still work with remote repositories in this
        format
    -   Local repositories can still be upgraded via "darcs
        optimize --upgrade".
-   The --ephemeral and --partials options to "darcs get" has en
    removed. "darcs check --partial" has also been removed.
-   "darcs rollback" now has a --no-record option, to be used en
    you only want to update the working directory.

-   The --nolinks option for "darcs get" was removed.
-   The "--old" flag has been removed for "darcs init", "darcs
    get" and "darcs put".
-   "darcs resolve" has been removed an alias for "darcs
    mark-conflicts".
-   ssh ControlMaster support has been removed.

## Issues resolved in Darcs 2.8
-   issue1266: "darcs init" now warns when run inside another
    darcs repo.
-   issue1344: When using darcs send, let users know sooner if
    they won't eventually be able to send
-   issue1397: darcs changes /bad /paths no longer lists all
    changes
-   issue1473: problem with annotate --repodir
-   issue1551: Now we only use 'file content did not change'
    prompt for darcs send
-   issue1558: xml output for patch hash no longer includes "gz"
    extension
-   issue1599: automatically expire unused caches
-   issue1637: When darcs get fails due to a HTTP failure, port
    the actual HTTP failure.
-   issue1640: darcs apply --verbose docs have been improved
-   issue1661: darcs add --quiet is quieter
-   issue1705: fix error with unhandled --index in "darcs show
    contents"

    "ALL" default with a default for a specific sub-command
-   issue1727: a better diagnostic message is provided when the
    user tries to move the root of the repository

    not exist" has been improved

-   issue2079: "darcs put" now does --set-default by default

# Todo-list for the release

1.  Benchmarks, please use darcs-benchmark on HEAD, and report;
    currently, darcs-benchmark is broken for two reasons:
    a.  it does not compile with modern ghcs. For this, please get it
        from darcs get
        [http://tausenblum.lautre.net/darcsystuff/darcs-benchmark](http://tausenblum.lautre.net/darcsystuff/darcs-benchmark)
        for a modernized versions
    b.  The benchmarks repositories are not available anymore. If you
        have them somewhere, then you can use them (skip darcs-benchmark
        get); otherwise, we'll make them available as soon as possible

2.  Exotic platform support: we need someone to check that installing on
    windows and mac works. We'll also need a windows installer and
    something (what?) on mac.

3.  Check for release blocking bugs and regressions, please use the
    betas and report issues.

4.  Marketing: where do we announce and how?
