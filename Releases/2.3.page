# Darcs 2.3.1 announcement (2009-09-20): better docs, fewer bugs

Dear Darcs users,

The darcs team would like to announce the immediate availability of a
new stable version of darcs, 2.3.1. This is a bugfix release. The
user-visible changes are:

> -   Fix bugs in optimizations in 2.3.0
> -   Documentation improvements
> -   Remove autoconf build system

A more complete list of changes in this and older versions of darcs can
be found at [http://www.darcs.net/NEWS](http://www.darcs.net/NEWS) .

## Installing

You can obtain the source tarball at the following address:

> -   [http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.3.1.tar.gz](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.3.1.tar.gz)

The build instructions are available in the enclosed README file in
those tarballs.

Moreover, if you have cabal-install available, you can install latest
stable release of darcs by issuing the following commands (no tarballs
needed):

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install darcs

This should give you a darcs binary in \`\~/.cabal/bin\` -- you should
probably add this to your PATH. More detailed instructions for
installing on Windows are available near the end of this announcement.

## Installing on Windows

To install darcs on Windows systems from scratch, please download the
Haskell Platform and MSYS:

> -   [http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/2009.2.0.1/HaskellPlatform-2009.2.0.1-setup.exe](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/2009.2.0.1/HaskellPlatform-2009.2.0.1-setup.exe)
> -   [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS+Base+System/MSYS-1.0.11-rc-1.exe/download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS+Base+System/MSYS-1.0.11-rc-1.exe/download)

After installing both, you should have an "MSYS" icon: run MSYS and in
the terminal window type (the \`$\` character denotes the prompt, do not
repeat it):

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install darcs -f-curl

This should download, compile and install all required dependencies and
also darcs itself. The resulting darcs executable will be placed into
the Haskell Platform executables folder, and should be accessible from
the MSYS shell (just type "darcs --version" to check).

Yours,
  ~ Reinier.

# Darcs 2.3.0 announcement (2009-07-23)

Hello!

I'd like to announce immediate availability of a new stable release of
darcs, 2.3.0. There is a number of improvements and bugfixes over the
previous stable release, 2.2. Moreover, work has been done to improve
performance of "darcs whatsnew" for large repositories.

As in the past, there are two source tarballs available. As of this
release, the cabal-based build is preferred, and the autoconf build is
deprecated. You can obtain the source tarballs at these addresses:

> -   [http://repos.mornfall.net/darcs/darcs-2.3.0.tar.gz](http://repos.mornfall.net/darcs/darcs-2.3.0.tar.gz)
> -   [http://repos.mornfall.net/darcs/darcs-2.3.0\_autoconf.tar.gz](http://repos.mornfall.net/darcs/darcs-2.3.0_autoconf.tar.gz)

The build instructions are available in the enclosed README file in
those tarballs.

Moreover, if you have cabal-install available, you can install latest
stable release of darcs by issuing the following commands (no tarballs
needed):

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install darcs

This should give you a darcs binary in \`\~/.cabal/bin\` -- you should
probably add this to your PATH. More detailed instructions for
installing on Windows are available near the end of this announcement.

## The question of GHC 6.8

Using GHC 6.10.3 or newer is *strongly recommended*. You may compile
darcs with GHC 6.8, but there are several caveats. If you are using
6.8.2 or older, please disable mmap support (pass -f-mmap to cabal
install or runghc Setup configure). Note that the GHC 6.8.2 that ships
with Debian Lenny is not affected and it should be safe to keep mmap
enabled. It is also recommended to disable use of Hackage zlib when
compiling with GHC 6.8.2 (including the Debian Lenny version): pass
-f-zlib to cabal. When using zlib, we have seen occasional crashes with
error messages like "openBinaryFile: file locked" -- this is a known GHC
6.8.2 bug (and is fixed in GHC 6.8.3). Last, if you are using a 64-bit
system, darcs may hang when you exit a pager when compiled with GHC
older than 6.10.3. Although this is harmless, it is quite inconvenient.

Overall, the status of GHC 6.8 is "semi-supported": for many cases,
things will work just fine, especially if you take a little extra
caution with compilation flags.

## Installing on Windows

To install darcs on Windows systems from scratch, please download the
Haskell Platform and MSYS:

> -   [http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/2009.2.0.1/HaskellPlatform-2009.2.0.1-setup.exe](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/2009.2.0.1/HaskellPlatform-2009.2.0.1-setup.exe)
> -   [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS+Base+System/MSYS-1.0.11-rc-1.exe/download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS+Base+System/MSYS-1.0.11-rc-1.exe/download)

After installing both, you should have an "MSYS" icon: run MSYS and in
the terminal window type (the \`$\` character denotes the prompt, do not
repeat it):

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install darcs -f-curl

This should download, compile and install all required dependencies and
also darcs itself. The resulting darcs executable will be placed into
the Haskell Platform executables folder, and should be accessible from
the MSYS shell (just type "darcs --version" to check).

Yours,
  ~ Petr.
