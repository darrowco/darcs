# What's new in 2.10.0 (released 2015-04-19) #

## New features ##

- [`darcs rebase`](/Using/Rebase): enable deep amending of history
  (Ganesh Sittampalam)
- `darcs pull --reorder`: keep local-only patches on top of mainstream patches
  (Ale Gadea, Ganesh Sittampalam)
- `darcs dist --zip`: generate a zip archive from a repository
  (Guillaume Hoffmann)
- patch bundle contexts are minimized by default.
  Enables bundles to be applied to more repositories. (Guillaume Hoffmann)
- [`darcs convert export/import`](/Using/Convert) for conversion
  to/from VCSes supporting the fast-export protocol (Petr Rockai,
  Owen Stephens, Guillaume Hoffmann, Lele Gaifax, Ben Franksen)
- [`darcs test --backoff`](/Using/Test): exponential backoff test strategy,
  faster than bisect on big repositories (Michael Hendricks)
- [work normally on sshfs-mounted repositories](/SSH) (Nathaniel Filardo)
- [automatic detection of file/directory moves, and of token replaces](/Using/Record)
  (Jose Neder)
- patience diff algorithm by default (Jose Neder)
- interactive mode for whatsnew (Dan Frumin) 
- `tag --ask-deps` to create tags that may not include some patches
  (Ganesh Sittampalam)

## User Interface ##

- add a last question after all patches have been selected to confirm
  the whole selection (Florent Becker)
- [command names](/RosettaStone):
    - `clone` is the new name of `get` and `put`
    - `log`   is the new name of `changes`
    - `amend` is the new name of `amend-record`
- show output of `log` into a pager by default (Guillaume Hoffmann)
- the output of `log` is more similar to git's:
    - show patch hash in UI (hash of the patch's metadata)
    - put author and date on separate lines (Guillaume Hoffmann)
- enable to match on patch hash prefix with -h and --hash
 (Guillaume Hoffmann, Gian Piero Carrubba)
- better messages:
    - better error messages for http and ssh errors (Ernesto Rodriguez)
    - `init`, `add`, `remove`, `move` and `replace` print
      confirmation messages (Guillaume Hoffmann)
- `rollback` only happens in the working copy (Florent Becker, Guillaume Hoffmann)
- `darcs send` no longer tries to send a mail by default (Eric Kow)
- when no patch name given, directly invoke text editor (Jose Neder, Guillaume Hoffmann)
- use nano as default text editor instead of vi (Guillaume Hoffmann)
- keep log files for patch name and mail content in _darcs (Ale Gadea)
- `optimize` and `convert` are now supercommands (Guillaume Hoffmann)
- improve `darcs help environment` and `darcs help markdown` (Radoslav Dorcik, Guillaume Hoffmann)
- warn about duplicate tags when creating a new one (Ale Gadea)
- allow `darcs mv` into known, but deleted in working, file (Owen Stephens)
- improve` --not-in-remote`, allowing multiple repos and use default (Owen Stephens)

## Performance ##

- faster `darcs diff` (Petr Rockai)

  Benedikt Schmidt, Eric Kow, Guillaume Hoffmann, Ganesh Sittampalam)
- faster push via ssh by using compression (Ben Franksen)
- cloning to an ssh destination (formerly `darcs put`) is more efficient
  (Guillaume Hoffmann)
