# Darcs 2.4.4 announcement (2010-05-23)

Hi all,

The darcs team would like to announce the immediate availability of
darcs 2.4.4. This release fixes a couple of issues that were found in
Darcs 2.4.3. We strongly recommend that everybody using Darcs 2.4.x
upgrade to this version. As of this release, official binaries are
available for both Windows and MacOS X:

> -   [http://darcs.net/binaries/windows/darcs-2.4.4-win1.zip](http://darcs.net/binaries/windows/darcs-2.4.4-win1.zip)
> -   [http://darcs.net/binaries/macosx/darcs-2.4.4-OSX-10.6-i386.tar.gz](http://darcs.net/binaries/macosx/darcs-2.4.4-OSX-10.6-i386.tar.gz)

The easiest way to install darcs from source is using the Haskell
Platform [1]. If you have installed the Haskell Platform or
cabal-install, you can install this release by doing:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install darcs

Alternatively, you can download the tarball from
[http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.4\_1.tar.gz](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.4_1.tar.gz)
and build it by hand as explained in the README file.

## What's New

-   Important changes in Darcs 2.4.4

    -   darcs builds on Windows with GHC 6.10 (and GHC 6.12).
    -   darcs (built with GHC 6.12 on Windows) works with SSH again

-   Issues resolved in Darcs 2.4.4

    -   1814: Apply binary mode to ssh process and patch file handles.

## Known Issues

Aside from our fine list of bugs at
[http://bugs.darcs.net](http://bugs.darcs.net) , there is a minor issue
with the binaries for this release: darcs --exact-version does not
report the Darcs version. This is due to a release flub on my end. We
will correct the binaries within a week and post new links to the wiki.
To avoid this error, packagers for other platforms should take note to
use the '\_1' version of the tarball above.

We have had several mishaps in the Darcs 2.4 series and were not
expecting to do these many point releases. I would like to apologise for
any inconvenience we have caused. The good news is that thanks to these
these recent problems, we have tightened up our release quality control
process (buildbot testing of the release branch on 3 major platforms,
better coordination release manager and packagers), and hope to have a
much smoother Darcs 2.5 release this summer.

## Reporting Bugs

If you do have an issue with this version of Darcs, you can report it
via the web on [http://bugs.darcs.net](http://bugs.darcs.net)/ . You can
also report bugs by email to [bugs@darcs.net](mailto:bugs@darcs.net).

# Darcs 2.4.3 announcement (2010-05-09)

The darcs team would like to announce the immediate availability of
darcs 2.4.3. Darcs is a distributed, advanced revision control system
written in Haskell.

This release [1] fixes a number of issues that were found in darcs
2.4.1. We strongly recommend that everybody using Darcs 2.4.0 or 2.4.1
upgrade to this version. The two most important issues resolved were
that Darcs would fail on Windows with an "mmap of \_darcs/index", and
that darcs get --partial would produce inconsistent repositories.

The easiest way to install darcs is using the Haskell Platform [2]. If
you have installed the Haskell Platform or cabal-install, you can
install this release by doing:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install darcs

Alternatively, you can download the tarball from
[http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.3.tar.gz](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.3.tar.gz)
and build it by hand as explained in the README file.

## What's New

-   Important changes in Darcs 2.4.3

    -   darcs will no longer give "mmap of \_darcs/index" errors on
        Windows
    -   darcs convert performance regression (against 2.3.x) solved
    -   darcs get --partial no longer produces inconsistent repositories
    -   GHC 6.12 support on Windows

-   Issues resolved in Darcs 2.4.3

    -   1761: mmap of '\_darcs/index' failed on Windows mapped drives
    -   1814: include contrib/darcs-errors.hlint in release tarball
    -   1823: read (mmap) \_darcs/index file correctly on Windows
    -   1826: error building on Windows with GHC 6.12
    -   1837: inconsistent repository upon darcs get --partial

## Reporting bugs

If you have an issue with darcs 2.4.3, you can report it via the web on
[http://bugs.darcs.net](http://bugs.darcs.net)/ . You can also report
bugs by email to [bugs@darcs.net](mailto:bugs@darcs.net).

error under GHC 6.12 on Windows

# Darcs 2.4.1 announcement (2010-04-12)

Hi all,

The darcs team would like to announce the immediate availability of
darcs 2.4.1. This release fixes a number of issues that were found in
darcs 2.4. The most important of these issues were that darcs did not
work on Windows shares, and that darcs would not work if it was built
with a wrong version of the mmap package.

The easiest way to install darcs is using the Haskell Platform [1]. If
you have installed the Haskell Platform or cabal-install, you can
install this release by doing:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install --reinstall darcs

Alternatively, you can download the tarball from
[http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.1.tar.gz](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.1.tar.gz)
and build it by hand as explained in the README file.

## What's New

-   Important changes in Darcs 2.4.1

> -   darcs works again on Windows network shares
> -   missing documentation and test files have been added to the
>     tarball
> -   darcs will no longer give errors about a nonexistent file when
>     compiled with the wrong mmap
> -   moving files between directories can no longer break the directory
>     index
> -   darcs handles the case that someone uses 'remove -r' on an
>     untracked directory
> -   darcs ignores symlinks again, like all pre-2.4 releases

-   Bugs Fixed in Darcs 2.4.1

> -   1645: ignore symlinks
> -   1750: uncover help text for 'darcs show pristine'
> -   1753: restrict mmap to version used by hashed-storage
> -   1754: fix issue458.sh on systems with xattrs
> -   1756: moving files between directories breaks index
> -   1757: add test files to distribution tarball
> -   1765: refuse to remove non-tracked directories recursively
> -   1767: send CRC erros to standard error

## Reporting bugs

If you have an issue with darcs 2.4.1, you can report it via the web on
[http://bugs.darcs.net](http://bugs.darcs.net)/ . You can also report
bugs by email to [bugs@darcs.net](mailto:bugs@darcs.net).

# Darcs 2.4.0 announcement (2010-02-07)

February 27, 2010 - The darcs team is proud to announce the immediate
availability of darcs 2.4. darcs 2.4 contains many improvements and
bugfixes compared to darcs 2.3.1. Highlights are the faster operation of
record, revert and related commands, and the experimental interactive
hunk editing.

The easiest way to install darcs is using the Haskell Platform [1]. If
you have installed the Haskell Platform or cabal-install, you can
install this beta release by doing:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install --reinstall darcs

Alternatively, you can download the tarball from
[[http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.tar.gz](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.tar.gz)](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.4.tar.gz),
and build it by hand as explained in the README file.

## Interactive hunk editing

To try out interactive hunk editing, press 'e' when you are prompted
with a hunk patch by 'darcs record'. You will then be shown an editor
screen in which you can edit the state you want to record between the
last two ruler lines.

You can find more information about the hunk editing feature on [the
hunk editor wiki page](http://wiki.darcs.net/HunkEditor).

## Performance

darcs in its current form does not perform very well on huge
repositories. In order to systematically address this issue, and to
catch performance regressions, we have started a darcs benchmarking
project. You can find benchmarks of darcs performance in many different
situations on [the benchmarks wiki
page](http://wiki.darcs.net/Benchmarks). On [this other wiki
page](http://wiki.darcs.net/Benchmarks/Quasar), you will find graphs of
the benchmark results on a Windows Vista machine.

On that page, you will also find instructions on how to run your own
darcs benchmarks.

## Reporting bugs

If you have an issue with darcs 2.4, you can report it via the web on
[http://bugs.darcs.net](http://bugs.darcs.net)/ . You can also report
bugs by email to [bugs@darcs.net](mailto:bugs@darcs.net).
