# Darcs 2.5.2 announcement (2011-03-14)

Hi,

The darcs team is pleased to announce the release of darcs 2.5.2, a
minor upgrade for the 2.5 release.

This release bumps the parsec dependency that was missed in 2.5.1,
ensuring full compatibility with the recent 2011.2.0.0 release. It also
fixes a nasty regression from 2.4 where darcs allowed you to add files
inside boring directories to the repository.

## Installing

The easiest way to install darcs 2.5.2 from source is by first
installing the Haskell Platform
([http://www.haskell.org/platform)](http://www.haskell.org/platform)).
If you have installed the Haskell Platform or cabal-install, you can
install this release by doing:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install darcs-2.5.2

Alternatively, you can download the tarball from
[http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.5.2.tar.gz](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.5.2.tar.gz)
and build it by hand as explained in the README file.

Versions of GHC from 6.10.x to 7.0.x are supported.

The 2.5 branch is also available as a darcs repository from
[http://darcs.net/releases/branch-2.5](http://darcs.net/releases/branch-2.5)

## Binaries

These will be posted to
[http://wiki.darcs.net/Binaries](http://wiki.darcs.net/Binaries) as they
become available.

## Reporting bugs

If you have an issue with darcs 2.5.2, you can report it via the web on
[http://bugs.darcs.net](http://bugs.darcs.net)/ . You can also report
bugs by email to bugs at darcs.net.

## Changelog

> -   Bump parsec dependency to support 3.1
>
> -   Refuse to add files that are inside boring directories
>
>     This was a regression from the 2.4 series and led to broken
>     patches because the parent directory was not added.

## Changelog

> -   Include original text in conflict marks

>     Conflicts are now marked up as

>     v v v v v v v original text before any conflicting patch
>     ============= conflicting result A *****\******\*\* conflicting
>     result B .... \^ \^ \^ \^ \^ \^ \^

>     The inclusion of the original text makes it much easier to

>
>     This is only an incremental improvement to our conflict marking,
>     which we understand is still hard to use. More substantial
>     improvements are in the works.

>
> -   Restrict the GHC version in the cabal file

>     This means that cabal builds will explicitly fail if an

>
> -   Update warning message about old-fashioned repositories

>
>     Darcs normally checks for paths that point outside the repository

>     get.
>
> -   Darcs library API: make the "program name" configurable
>
>     This makes it easier for external users of the library API to
>     reuse Darcs' framework for handling commands.
>
> -   darcs send now prints the remote repository address up front

>     Previously it would first read the remote repository, which made

# Darcs 2.5 announcement (2010-10-30)

Hi all,

The darcs team is proud to announce the release of darcs 2.5. Darcs 2.5
contains many improvements over the 2.4 series. Most notable are the
performance improvements in record and pull and the --bisect option for
trackdown.

The easiest way to install darcs 2.5 is using the Haskell Platform [1].
If you have installed the Haskell Platform or cabal-install, you can
install this release by doing:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install darcs

Alternatively, you can download the tarball from
[[http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.5.tar.gz](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.5.tar.gz)](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-2.5.tar.gz)
and build it by hand as explained in the README file.

## What's New

A list of important changes since darcs 2.4.4:

-   trackdown can now do binary search with the --bisect option
-   darcs always stores patch metadata encoded with UTF-8
-   diff now supports the --index option
-   amend-record now supports the --ask-deps option
-   apply now supports the --match option
-   amend-record has a new --keep-date option
-   inventory-changing commands (like record and pull) now operate in
    constant time with respect to the number of patches in the
    repository
-   the push, pull, send and fetch commands no longer change the default
    repository address by default
-   the --edit-description option is now on by default for the send
    command
