# Darcs 2.2.0 announcement (2009-01-16)

Hi all!

I am happy to announce general availability of darcs 2.2.0.

## Getting the release

For this release, we have decided to provide two flavours, depending on
the build system used:

1)  The source tarball,
    <[http://www.darcs.net/darcs-2.2.0.tar.gz](http://www.darcs.net/darcs-2.2.0.tar.gz)\>,
    which can be built using the traditional autoconf-based system. This
    is the fully supported version. After downloading and unpacking, you
    can issue:

        $ ./configure
        $ make

    and possibly

        # make install

    More detailed instructions inside the tarball (file README).

    Please note that we had at least one report of build failure, with
    quickcheck-related message. The currently best workaround, if this
    happens to you, is to use the cabal version of the package instead,
    see below.

2)  Cabalised source. You can either download a tarball from
    <[http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/darcs/2.2.0/darcs-2.2.0.tar.gz](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/darcs/2.2.0/darcs-2.2.0.tar.gz)\>
    and build manually (see the build instructions in README inside the
    tarball), or, alternatively, you can use cabal-install to obtain a
    copy:

        $ cabal update
        $ cabal install darcs

    This will give you a darcs binary in \~/.cabal/bin -- you should
    probably add that to your PATH.

In addition to source tarballs, we expect binary packages for various
UNIX platforms will be available in due time.

For Windows users, Salvatore Insalaco has prepared a binary build,
available from
[http://homepage.mac.com/kirby81\_it/darcs/darcs-2.2.0-win1.zip](http://homepage.mac.com/kirby81_it/darcs/darcs-2.2.0-win1.zip).
You just need to unpack the directory somewhere and add it to your path
(if you like).

Moreover, an experimental TortoiseDarcs release for darcs 2 has been
made available by Kari Hoijarvi <hoijarvi-at-seas-dot-wustl-dot-edu\>
and is looking for home. It can be found at
<[http://datafed.net/darcs](http://datafed.net/darcs)\> (unfortunately,
at the time of this writing, the site seemed unreachable... If you can
help with hosting, please mail Kari.)

And a summary of issues that have been fixed in darcs since version
2.1.2 (compiled by Thorkil Naur):

    525     amend-record => darcs patches show duplicate additions
    971     darcs check fails (case sensitivity on filenames)
    1006    darcs check and repair do not look for adds
    1043    pull => mergeAfterConflicting failed in geteff (2.0.2+)
    1101    darcs send --cc recipient not included in success message
    1117    Whatsnew should warn on non-recorded files
    1144    Add darcs send --in-reply-to or --header "In-Reply-To: <x...@y.z>"
    1165    get should print last gotten tag
    1196    Asking for changes in /. of directory that doesn't exist gives changes 
    in entire repo
    1198    Reproducible "mergeConflictingNons failed in geteff with ix"
    1199    Backup files darcs added after external merge
    1223    sporadic init.sh test failure (2.1.1rc2+472)
    1238    wish: darcs help setpref should list all prefs
    1247    make TAGS is broken
    1249    2.1.2 (+ 342 patches) local drive detection on Windows error
    1272    amend-record not the same as unrecord + record
    1273    renameFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)
    1223    sporadic init.sh test failure (2.1.1rc2+472)

I would like to thank all contributors for making this release possible.

## Future

The next release will be 2.2.1, fixing low-risk issues found in 2.2.0,
or those that have been excluded for 2.2.0 due to freeze. This release
will appear in two or three weeks time, depending on circumstances.

The next major release will be 2.3, due in June or July this year. The
focus of this release will be new features and further work on
performance. Moreover, we expect that it will use Cabal as its default
build system and will make first steps towards sustainable libdarcs API.

Yours,
  ~ Petr.
