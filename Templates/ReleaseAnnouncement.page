# Darcs @VERSION@ announcement (@DATE@)

The darcs team would like to announce the immediate availability of
darcs @XXX@, a distributed, advanced revision control system written in
Haskell.

This release fixes a number of issues that were found in darcs
@PREVIOUS\_VERSION@. ((MAYBE? We strongly recommend that WHO? upgrade to
this version.)). ((UP TO THREE IMPORTANT CHANGES))

The easiest way to install darcs is using the Haskell Platform [1]. If
you have installed the Haskell Platform or cabal-install, you can
install this release by doing:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install darcs

Alternatively, you can download the tarball from
[http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-@VERSION@.tar.gz](http://darcs.net/releases/darcs-@VERSION@.tar.gz)
and build it by hand as explained in the README file.

## What's New

-   Important changes in Darcs @VERSION@

-   Issues resolved in Darcs @VERSION@

        the last release))
