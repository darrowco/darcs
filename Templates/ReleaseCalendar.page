# Major releases

Following existing practice and the guidelines on
[http://wiki.darcs.net/Development/ReleaseManagement](http://wiki.darcs.net/Development/ReleaseManagement),
we will have a two-week soft freeze, followed by a two week deep freeze,
followed by the release.

The start of the soft freeze (day N) will be @XXX@day @DD@ @MMM@

  ------------- ------ ------- --------- -------------------------------------
  On @XXX@day   @DD@   @MMM@   (N+3),    beta 1 is tagged and released
  On @XXX@day   @DD@   @MMM@   (N+14),   the release branch is deep
                                         -frozen
  On @XXX@day   @DD@   @MMM@   (N+17),   beta 2 is tagged and relased
  On @XXX@day   @DD@   @MMM@   (N+24),   rc1 is taggd and released
  On @XXX@day   @DD@   @MMM@   (N+30),   rc2 or final is tagged and released
  ------------- ------ ------- --------- -------------------------------------

During the soft freeze, only fixes for serious issues and patches
achieving release targets will be pulled to the release branch. The end
of the release cycle is uncertain: when new bugs are found in a release
candidate, there will be another RC a week later. Only when bugs are not
found in a release candidate for a week, it will be tagged and released
as darcs @X.Y.0@
