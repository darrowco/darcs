[Darcs Weekly News](http://blog.darcs.net/search/label/dwn) provides a summary
of darcs activity for people who are unable to follow the darcs-users
mailing list fully.

# How to contribute

DWN is mostly automated -- we have a Haskell script that parses darcs
changes output and formats it nicely -- but we also need human editors
to summarise activity on mailing lists and the blogosphere. To help out,

    darcs get --lazy http://wiki.darcs.net

and write a patch to the DarcsWeeklyNews directory (or just use the web
interface).

DWN is currently edited by Guillaume.
