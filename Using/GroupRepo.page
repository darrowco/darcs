title: Setting up a shared group repository
...

*WARNING: this is a work in progress*

The aim of this document is to produce a checklist of things you need to do to set up a shared darcs directory on a server that different users can push to.

# Basic checklist

We assume here that you are doing all of these steps as superuser

1. create a group for the users in question and add them to it

          addgroup cool-people
          adduser bob cool-people
          adduser sue cool-people

1. ensure that all users in question have umask 002 (sorry!)
 
1. create a directory owned by that group

          mkdir /srv/repos/cool-project

1. create the darcs directory itself

           # could be darcs get too
           darcs init --repo /srv/repos/cool-project

1. make sure the directory is group writable and that subdirectories inherit the group id

           chgrp -R cool-people /srv/repos/cool-project
           chmod -R g+rwXs /srv/repos/cool-project

1. make sure that people writing to the repo in a way that allows others in the group to overwrite the files

           echo 'apply umask 002' > /srv/repos/cool-project/_darcs/prefs/defaults

# Useful concepts in a nutshell

* umask: applying a more liberal umask (002 as opposed to 022) ensures that fewer permissions are stripped off by default
* setgid bit (chmod g+s): on a dir, ensures that new files inherit the group ID

# Things that can go wrong

* darcs: _darcs/index: opening of '_darcs/index' failed: permission denied (Permission denied)

     - I think this is not specific to _darcs/index.  It's just that you inherited overly strict permissions on that file.  chmod g+w it just this once.  You basically need to work out why this file is getting recreated with g-w; most likely the user has not set umask 002

* files are sometimes owned by root, why not the user that pushes them?
