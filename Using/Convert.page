So you have a Darcs repository, but your users would prefer to use
Git/Hg as a client. How can we make this easy? Our hope is to
provide easy copy-and-pasteable recipes for contributing to Darcs-hosted
projects via another DVCS.

# Exporting to Git

The simplest way is to use Darcs 2.10 with its
command `darcs convert export`.

For a one-time export you can use the recipe:

    $ cd repo
    $ git init ../mirror
    $ darcs convert export | (cd ../mirror && git fast-import)

For incremental export using marksfiles (to maintain a git mirror of a darcs repository):

    $ cd repo
    $ git init ../mirror
    $ touch ../mirror/git.marks
    $ darcs convert export --read-marks darcs.marks --write-marks darcs.marks
       | (cd ../mirror && git fast-import --import-marks=git.marks --export-marks=git.marks)

# Importing from Git

Only one-time import is currently available (as opposed to incremental).

To convert a git repository to darcs (suppose that git-repo is the directory contains
git source code, and darcs-repo is the directory for darcs)

    $ (cd git-repo; git fast-export --all --progress 500) | darcs convert --import darcs-repo

# One-time conversion from darcs-1 semantics to darcs-2 semantics

See [DarcsTwo](/DarcsTwo) for more information about this.
