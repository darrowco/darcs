title: Old-fashioned repository upgrade instructions
...

There exist three Darcs repository formats: old-fashioned (OF), hashed and darcs-2.
Versions 2.5.x of Darcs are the last one that ensure full support of OF
repositories. From version 2.8 (2012) , this support is limited and
users are invited to upgrade their OF repositories to hashed.

The commands that can still be run on local OF repositories are:

-   changes
-   show
-   optimize --upgrade
-   whatsnew

The commands that can be run against remote OF repositories are:

-   clone
-   pull
-   send

Moreover, it is possible to do a *remote* push to an OF repo, that is,
pushing via ssh if the remote machine's Darcs binary is able to write
into OF repositories.

Checkpoints are no longer supported in Darcs 2.8 and later. That is,
the `--partial` flag for cloning repositories is no longer available.

# How to know the format of a repository

Run the following command in a repository:

    darcs show repo

If you find the line:

    Pristine: PlainPristine

then you have an OF repository. If not, it should instead read:

    Pristine: HashedPristine

# Ensuring everyone is using Darcs 2

Darcs 2 is required to work with hashed repositories. Hence, the hashed
format is always safe on a "client" machine, but if you have other
people pulling from your repo, or sending to it, then you have to make
sure they have Darcs 2 before going hashed.

See [Binaries]() for instructions on building Darcs and pre-built
binaries.

# Converting a repository to the hashed format

With Darcs 2.4 and later, you can upgrade an existing repository
in-place with a single command:

    darcs optimize --upgrade

With Darcs older than 2.4, you can use the following steps:

    darcs get ./myrepo ./hashedrepo                        # make a hashed clone
    cp ./myrepo/_darcs/prefs/*  ./hashedrepo/_darcs/prefs/ # copy local settings
    mv ./myrepo ./oldrepo
    mv ./hashedrepo ./myrepo

Then `./oldrepo` is your OF backup and `./myrepo` is the hashed version.
