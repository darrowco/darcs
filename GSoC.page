# What this is about


See the [official GSoC FAQ and timelines](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a program that helps students getting
an experience of contributing to some free software project.
Darcs has been participating for several years to this program as
a way to 1) enable existing contributors to dedicate fully to darcs
for a few months, and also 2) enable students to have an experience
in a free software organization.

Check out the [student guide](GSoC/Guide) to know what you're
getting into.

# Project ideas

You can find some ideas for a Google Summer of Code student project
on the [projects page](Projects) of this website.

Note that these themes are just to get you started. We welcome
submissions beyond these initial ideas. Get in touch with us!
<darcs-users@darcs.net> or \#darcs on freenode.

All of these projects require good Haskell skills.
We trust and appreciate students who have contributed to darcs before applying :-)

# Application process

1.  Sketch out an idea. Can you make Darcs faster? Can you make it more
    useful? It would make sense to get in touch with
    <darcs-users@darcs.net> for some help.

2.  Get in touch with the Darcs team if you have not done so already

3.  Write up your proposal (this should take a day or two). See the
    previous applications if you're having trouble getting started.

4.  Submit your application to [the GSoC website](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014)
    Register as a student first then submit your application.
