# What are subrepositories?

# What should using subrepositories be like?

It should...

-   retain darcs' simplicity
-   allow the user to do operation once - i.e. one record for all
    subrepositories
-   prevent subrepository boundaries from being crossed
-   (fancy?) make it possible to share subrepositories across different
    parent repos
-   Andrew's wish: track subrepository patches with the umbrella
    repository, but allow for selectively pulling patches from the
    subproject's original repository into this one, as well as pushing
    them back out. (say, I wanted my own branch of project B as part of
    my project A, and wanted to keep B updated by pulling patches into
    it from the outside, and pushing my own patches to B back out to the
    community, all the while keeping my own version of B as just a part
    of project A, with patches to A and B all together.

# How could do we accomplish this?

## List of proposals

1.  Explicit support for [NestedRepositories](NestedRepositories) via
    special patch types
