Just collecting some notes on how darcs/patch-tracker integration might
work. The objective is to simplify the task of reviewing patches. The
rough idea is for each patch to provide a repository (much like in
Gerrit), eg. darcs get
[http://bugs.darcs.net/patch698](http://bugs.darcs.net/patch698)

# context

-   some white-listed (?) repositories: unstable, screened,
    hashed-storage, fast-convert
-   search for one of these keywords in Darcs-URL
-   darcs get --context foo.dpatch url

# follow-ups

-   should it be one-repo-per-message? with symlinks to the latest
    message? eg darcs get
    [http://bugs.darcs.net/message39819](http://bugs.darcs.net/message39819),
    with patch389 being a symlink to that
-   what about patches that don't contain all the contents of prior?
-   should also recognise darcs send
    [http://bugs.darcs.net/patch387](http://bugs.darcs.net/patch387) -
    perhaps append
