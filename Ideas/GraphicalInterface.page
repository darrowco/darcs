# GUI ideas

-   a patch dependency visualiser
-   an iTunes-like interface to patches (click on the 'author' column,
    and you see the patches sorted by author, for example)
-   click on a patch and you get some subtle feedback on all the patches
    it depends on (for example, they change colour)
-   maybe some kind of help resolving conflicts? (no clear ideas)
-   A file browser that highlights files not added to the repository,
    files that have unrecorded changes, etc.
-   Diff visualisation
-   MacOS X - integration with [FileMerge](FileMerge)?
-   a generic diff visualiser, which would allow to pick-and-choose
    lines of code into a third file, a la Visual Source Safe and the
    open-source [kdiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/).
-   There should be two ways to use the darcs gui. One is to have a
    seperate gui for each command, so that you can run something like
    `darcs whatsnew -gui`. The other is to have a standalone gui.
-   The standalone gui could take a patch-oriented view towards
    repositories, rather than a task oriented one. That is, rather than
    decide you want to record some patches and then select the patches
    (for instance), you select a bunch of patches and decide you want to
    record them. (This is inspired from one of the patchworks'
    screenshots)
-   Ability to edit named patches by moving primitive patches back and
    forth between them (from Shae's request for a patch browser)

# Existing third-party projects that do not support darcs yet

Instead of starting a GUI from scratch, add a darcs support to an
existing GUI:

* [RabbitVCS](http://rabbitvcs.org)
* [QCT](http://qct.sourceforge.net)
* [GeanyVC](http://plugins.geany.org/geanyvc.html)

Or ensure Darcs is correcly supported in:

* [meld](http://meld.sourceforge.net/), a graphical diff viewer,
  handles darcs repositories: just type "meld ." inside of a darcs
  repo to see the unrecorded changes
* [Darcs support for the Emacs text editor](RelatedSoftware/Emacs)
* [darcs.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1683) - basic Darcs support for vim


# Old projects

Three students of the [BTU
Cottbus](http://www.tu-cottbus.de/btu/en.html) worked on a darcs GUI
application based on the
[Grapefruit](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Grapefruit) FRP library.
They were supervised by [Wolfgang
Jeltsch](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/User:Wolfgang_Jeltsch). See
[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Patchwork](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Patchwork)
for more details. The project is no longer maintained but the source
code is still available (waiting to be cabalized, for a start).
