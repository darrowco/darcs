Random musings on conflict marking:

-   Maybe should dump a file listing conflicts

-   Would like to effect of some non-hunk patches (eg. for graphical
    diff on (re)moved files) to be inserting a hunk at the beginning of
    a file like

        v v v v v v v
        moved from foo to bar
        ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

        v v v v v v v
        removed from repository
        ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

-   Maybe a fancy EffectPatch type or something so that these comments
    can just keep accumulating
