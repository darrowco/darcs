[Camp](http://projects.haskell.org/camp/) is a separate project to Darcs.

We expect ideas from Camp to feed into Darcs 3 but there's no current plan that Camp would actually become Darcs 3.

Significant points about Camp:

   * [repository format](http://projects.haskell.org/camp/repository)
   * proofs/axiomatization
   * better implementation of conflictors
