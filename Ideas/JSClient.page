The idea would be to propose a minimal darcs client written in
javascript, to solve the problem of grabbing a basic repository.

Ideally I'd like to see it eventually integrated to hub.darcs.net,
something like a "download zip" button.





# Questions

* is it better than a server-side generation of tar.gz?
  after all darcsden uses darcs.

The aim is to make it easy for someone to send a bugfix to a project.

The idea is to have a small and easily maintainable program. Hence, it
has to be reduced to the most vital features.

Maybe fancy commands like log (without flags, hence without -v) and
whatsnew could be added in a non-initial version.

# Roadmap

1.  get a working copy (from a local repository or http)
2.  get a complete clone of a darcs repository (local or http)
3.  log, ie, display the list of patches of the
    current repo
5.  whatsnew, ie, display changes between working copy and pristine
6.  revert -a, ie, reset working copy to pristine
7.  makebundle, ie, do a record -a and send -O

Bonus points for writing the test scripts alongside with the actual
code.

# To see

To generate a file on the fly in javascript so that the browser
can download it:

1. grab pristine hash
2. generate zip file in javascript in browser
3. create blob/base64 URI
4. pass it to browser to download as single file
