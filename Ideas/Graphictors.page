# Graphictors

# What are they?

A new design for representing conflicts, within patch-theory.

# Why are they needed?

The current "Conflictors" are confusing, badly (not?) understood by
current developers and perform badly.

# How do they work?

Conflicts are represented by graphs, where the edges are patches and the
nodes are contexts.
