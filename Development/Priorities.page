1.  [Clean up](Cleanup) darcs coding style and library
    (for example, cleaner separation between Darcs.Patches and
    Darcs.Repository).  New abstractions
    like the [Darcs monad](issue1895).

2.  Support Darcs hosting and GUIs.  Our goal is to have library code that
    makes it easier to write things like a Darcs based GitHub.  This means working
    with people behind services like Darcsden, and potentially
    writing code that uses that library to prove it works.

3.  Develop the Darcs 3 theory of patches.  We will focus on fixing conflict
    handling. The more exciting features (eg. more semantic patches) will
    likely have to wait for after.
