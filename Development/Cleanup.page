Darcs code quality could use a lot of improvement. Slow reformation is
the name of the game. Keeping heading towards better.

Here's how you can help:

1.  Hlint (also useful for sprints)

2.  [Coding style](CodingStyle)

3.  Hunt for duplicated code

4.  Check module import/export lists

5.  Break huge functions up into small pieces

6.  <http://darcs.net/api-doc> - haddocking darcs module by module

# Coverage issues

1.  [Internals](/Internals) : high-level developer docs; for example, do
    we have darcs code overview?

2.  Haddocks: we should have full coverage (or know that uncovered ones
    are obvious)

3.  Tests? But how?

# Bigger projects

1.  Darcs monad: issue1895

2.  Make patch library separate

3.  Kick out
    -   our getopt stuff for something like cmdlibs/args: issue1550
    -   path manipulation? issue1791
    -   spinning off crypto, edit distance libraries and more?

# Nebulous

1.  More 3rd party, less us.

    move it under Development maybe
