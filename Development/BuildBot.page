# Buildbot

The current buildmaster runs at
<http://buildbot.darcs.net>.

## Setting up a buildslave

First install buildbot on your system -- see
<http://buildbot.net> (your distribution may have packages, too).

You should have `cabal-install`: either from your distribution, or
bootstrap from
<http://haskell.org/cabal/download.html>
-- get the `cabal-install-0.x.y.tar.gz` on UNIX (if you are on Windows,
get the [haskell platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform)
instead). Make sure that the buildbot user account has access to the
cabal binary.

Now the following steps should be done *on behalf of the buildbot
user/account*:

-   Run `cabal update`.
-   Run `cabal install darcs`. This needs curl and (on UNIX) zlib
    development files... but you can use `-f-curl` to avoid curl).
-   Run
    `buildbot create-slave /path/to/working/area buildmaster.darcs.net:9988 bot_name bot_password`.

Additionally, you need a working darcs on your (buildbot's) PATH. You
can use the one you built by cabal above the binary is in
`$HOME/.cabal/bin/` on UNIX (we don't know about Windows).

Finally, e-mail the buildbot maintainer with your buildslave name and
password (currently Petr Rockai, me-at-mornfall-dot-net) and possibly
extra flags that you need to have passed to `Setup configure`
(`-w /path/to/ghc`, `-f-curl` and such). If you have multiple GHC
versions available, we would be happy to set up a builder for each GHC.

## Maintenance

Sometimes, darcs will require new versions of hackage libraries. There
are basically two options:

-   You can let the buildbot sort this out automatically: you need
    "cabal" binary on your (buildbot's) path -- this should be sorted if
    you followed the above instructions -- and you don't mind darcs
    builds installing hackage packages. Note you want this when you are
    sending the password.
-   You want to sort this manually: there's a script,
    contrib/install-deps.sh in the darcs source, which you can use: you
    need a current checkout of darcs (you can use the one in buildbot's
    scratch area).
