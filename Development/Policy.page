Darcs is not a particularly policy-driven project; we tend to make
decisions using case-by-case consensus. On the other hand, we sometimes
find it helpful to maintain a small set of rules for the sake of
consistency or efficiency. We will document these rules here as we grow
them.

# Buildbot

See [BuildBot](BuildBot) for details

# Communications

-   darcs-users: all discussions (user and developer); open to all
-   darcs-devel: automated traffic only (bugtracker, buildbot); open to
    all
-   darcs-private: sensitive discussions only, to be avoided where
    possible; open to \`darcs core team\` members (see top of
    [DarcsTeam](/DarcsTeam))

# Commit-bits

Rough consensus from the current pool of commit bit holders. May be
revised as the pool grows.

# Contribs

We welcome small third-party tools (eg. shell completion scripts) in our
contribs/ directory. Our only requirement is that they be maintained.
Bugs related to a contrib script can be tracked on
<http://bugs.darcs.net> if there is not already a
tracker for them. Note that if the tool or script appears to be
unmaintained - for example if we receive a bug report but get no
response from the maintainer - then we reserve the right to remove the
script outright. We will normally wait at least a month and make
multiple attempts to contact the maintainer. Re-submissions are of
course welcome when a maintainer is available.

# Copyright

-   Author keeps copyright
-   GPL (or more liberal) for source code
-   MIT for test suites

# Dependencies

Libraries we depend on should be GPL-compatible. If the patch author
introduce a new dependency that is not cabal installable, he or she
should post a heads-up on the mailing list as this will likely break
people's builds of Darcs.

# GHC and Haskell-Platform versions

We will support the last two stable branches of GHC (for which a Haskell
Platform has been released).

As a reference, here are the versions provided by Ubuntu:

* [GHC](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=ghc)
* [Haskell-Platform](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=haskell-platform)

Concretely, we support GHC versions as old as the one provided by the
current Debian stable.

# Politics

Benevolent Dictator chosen by an Oversight Committee and deposed with a
vote of at least 3/4 of its members.

See the [SFC
agreement](http://darcs.net/darcs-sponsorship-agreement.pdf) for details
(though the agreement technically only covers our relationship with the
SFC, we use it as the basis for our political system)
