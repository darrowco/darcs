(Experimental page) All our pending decisions/proposals at a glance.

Please keep twitteresque brevity. The point is to get a sort of
dashboard view Note that I may have misunderstood the discussion/mails,
hence the point of having an overview

Feel free to kill entries on the page as a way of saying "we don't need
to be thinking about this now"

This is basically a list of things which should be on our mental radars
