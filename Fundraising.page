# Previous fundraising drives

-   2009-03 (aim: $1000 for darcs hacking sprint travel, raised: $1025,
    spent: ?)

# Thoughts

We now know what to do with small amounts of money : pay for sprints
(travel, venues, etc). This stub is for organising our fundraising
mechanisms.

-   Who do people give money to?
-   How do we spend it?
-   How can we keep things lightweight?
-   Who do we ask for money?

# Possible uses for the money

-   Bounties?
-   Raising loads of cash to pay a developer for a year?
-   Getting Microsoft to hire an intern for us? [note: would need to
    BSD-license the relevant bits of darcs]
-   Pay for sprint venues and travel
-   [Hosting](Hosting) - how would darcs.net money help make this
    situation better?
