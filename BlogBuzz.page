# Darcs troubles

-   [darcs: a study in communication
    failure](https://lopsa.org/node/1656) (2008) *''The darcs revision
    control system has all but lost out to git within the past few
    months. A rather large part of the reason is a rushed and very
    poorly worded release announcement, following a rather long (I'm
    told 4 years; I haven't been aware of it that long, which itself is
    perhaps ominous) post-1.0 silence from the darcs developers''*
-   [Reexamining Darcs &
    Mercurial](http://changelog.complete.org/posts/588-Re-Examining-Darcs-Mercurial.html)
    (2007) *I continue to believe that it is the most distributed of the
    distributed VCSs, which is a Good Thing. However, I have lately
    started having trouble with Darcs hanging while working on my Debian
    packages.*
