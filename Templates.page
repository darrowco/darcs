Canned text can sometimes be useful if you need to repeat slight
variations on the same content.

A good way to use canned text is just to import in your text editor so
that you have the key dates/URLs/information and then personalise it.
While sending canned text is efficient, receiving it can be a bit
unpleasant; so a little personal touch would be very helpful when you
can afford it.
