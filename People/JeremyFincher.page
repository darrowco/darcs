I'm the original author of Supybot
[http://supybot.sf.net/](http://supybot.sf.net/), a Python IRC bot. I'm
moving our source code to Darcs, but there are a few things I'm not
happy about.

I want CVS keywords (or some similar functionality) in Darcs. I want to
be able, from within my running program, to find out what "version" of a
file is running. I want my hack to put my \_\_revision\_\_ string in
uncaught exceptions to continue to work, so I can see easily from the
exception whether a user needs to upgrade or not. Not all IRC bot users
are the brightest stars in their section of the sky; I need to be able
to \*know\* what version they're running, and not have to trust them
when they tell me what they \*think\* they're running.

You may be interested in searching the list archives on this topic, as
some other solutions have been suggested on how to achieve something
like CVS keywords. --[MarkStosberg](People/MarkStosberg)''

to insert into the sources?''
