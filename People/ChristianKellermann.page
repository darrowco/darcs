Christian is currently learning haskell by fixing
[ProbablyEasy](ProbablyEasy) bugs.

Points of interest so far:

-   Use the shell harness in Makefile
-   make [ShellHarness](ShellHarness) a module
-   use [ShellHarness](ShellHarness) in Setup.lhs
-   move shell\_harness to Distribution/ShellHarness.hs
-   make finds more portable
-   remove bash shell\_harness
-   Add [UserProfile](UserProfile) to test env for Windows
-   Fix shell\_harness so it uses --ignore-times
-   shell\_harness script in haskell
-   resolve issue1000: warn when tags are too short (length name <2)
-   resolve issue628: reuse the long comment code from Darcs.record
-   enable the use of $SENDMAIL for darcs send
-   call $(MAKE) instead of 'make', because GNUMake is not called 'make'
    everywhere

His usual findings are logged at [his
blog](http://pestilenz.org/~ckeen/blog/) but it does not contain
anything haskell related yet.
