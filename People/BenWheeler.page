I've been using darcs for a few months, trying to figure out whether it
is right for replacing CVS at my place of work. I find plenty to love
about it but a few important things hold me back.

-   I miss the concept of version numbers and RCS Keyword replacement,
    though if the former were available, the latter could be worked
    around.
-   It needs more hooks. There should be a hook pre and post every
    command that changes the repo.
-   Needs to honour, or version, the x-bit, though I think the latter is
    planned.
-   I like the flexibility of patch names, but I don't like the
    flexibility of patch names. :-) I would rather let darcs generate
    the actual patch name, so I know it's unique, and allow searching
    through the full text of patch descriptions for keywords such as Bug
    IDs fixed etc -- I want people to describe in detail, and itemised,
    the changes they have made in a particular patch, but the one-line
    patch name thing encourages the opposite. I guess I could write a
    wrapper script to ask what I think are the right questions, generate
    a patch name myself, and feed this to 'darcs record --logfile', but
    this would require asking the questions before asking which changes
    to record.
