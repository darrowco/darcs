As at June 2009, Trent W. Buck (twb) is an active member of the [Darcs
Team](../DarcsTeam). His contributions are to infrastructure rather than
the core code. They include:

-   Extensive improvements to Darcs' documentation.
-   Maintenance of the [Debian's Darcs
    package](http://packages.qa.debian.org/d/darcs.html);
-   Refactoring the (now deprecated) autoconf build infrastructure;
-   A command-line interface to our BTS, called
    [ru](http://code.haskell.org/~twb/ru/ru);
-   View-as-mailbox support for BTS tickets (see
    [issue1148](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1148)); and
-   Migration of wiki history from moinmoin to gitit.

Planned contributions include:

-   Unified documentation, using the Pandoc library to generate LaTeX,
    manpage and online ("darcs help") documentation from a single
    source;

-   Catch common typos in patch descriptions
    ([issue1094](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1094));
-   Improved functional test infrastructure
    ([issue1283](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1283)); and
-   Improved coverage of license (and copyright) declarations.
