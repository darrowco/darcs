## Why I like Darcs

Currently learning Python by running a project called Desipio (a file
manager). I liked the idea of Arch but then I found Darcs and found it
to be much easier to use. Once I'm completed my project, which is the
end of the school year, I plan to move from Sourceforge's CVS system to
full Darcs. The only reason I can't completely switch now is because my
partner also depends on CVS and we don't have the time to learn a new
revision control system at this point in time.
