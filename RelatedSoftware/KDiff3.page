Since it is not always very easy to merge using **Darcs** default
method, one may want to use third-party merge-tool for that. This page
is about making **Darcs** use open-source free tool KDiff3 as a merge
tool.

# How to

Fortunately, there is a convenient way to make **Darcs** use your own
merge GUI. Usually you would like to customize this setting for your
local user. So edit (or create) the file *\`\~/.darcs/defaults\`* adding
the following line to it:

>     ALL external-merge kdiff3 --output %o %a %1 %2

That is all. Now if there is any conflicts, you will have KDiff3 started
instead of just being informed of having *\`v v v\`* and *\`\^ \^ \^\`*
lines in files.
