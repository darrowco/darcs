# Shell Completion for darcs

Darcs completion is available for some command line shells. With this in
place, you can hit tab after 'darcs' on the command line, and the shell
will offer possible completions of the sub-command or option names.

## Bash Completion

A basic completion script is distributed with darcs. You can also
[download it](http://www.darcs.net/contrib/darcs_completion). It's
possible it may just work seamlessly for you. For example, once
`bash-completion` installed on Mandrake Linux, darcs completion works
after the 'darcs' Mandrake package has been installed.

Otherwise you may need to add a line to your bash profile to manually
source the file.

For fink users who have updated to darcs 1.01 or later, bash completion
should "just work," if you have also installed fink's `bash-completion`
package.

For OS X the following steps work:

-   Edit the above script following
    [http://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/darcs-users/2005-December/009073.html](http://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/darcs-users/2005-December/009073.html)
-   Add to \~/.bashrc: source \~/somepath/darcs\_completion
    Alternatively if you use Darwin Ports you can do (better):
-   port install bash-completion - this also enables lots of other fancy
    completions. Remember to follow the instructions r.e. adding a few
    lines to your \~/.bashrc.
-   copy the above script (unmodified this time) to
    /opt/local/etc/bash\_completion.d/

## Zsh Completion

Zsh completion scripts are distributed with darcs. You can download [the
completion file](http://www.darcs.net/contrib/_darcs.zsh) . The latest
version of zsh (currently available from CVS) comes with [darcs
completion](http://zsh.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=zsh/zsh;f=Completion/Unix/Command/_darcs;hb=HEAD)
by default (for those that use compinit completion).

## tcsh Completion

A simple tcsh completion:

    complete darcs 'p/1/(initialize get add remove mv whatsnew record unrecord \
                        amend-record revert unrevert pull unpull rollback send \
                        apply push replace tag setpref diff changes annotate \
                        optimize check resolve dist trackdown repair)/' \
                  'p/2/f/'

## fish Completion

[fish](http://roo.no-ip.org/fish/) version 1.14.0 and later ship with
command specific completions for darcs.

## Emacs Completion

Completion in the Emacs shell is also possible. See the [darcs emacs
page](Emacs) for more information.
