# Watching patches on IRC

The DarcsPatchWatch plugin for
[lambdabot](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot.html:) watches a
darcs repository and reports changes applied to the repository to an IRC
channel.

The channel to which change messages are sent is hardcoded into the
plugin's source code. The list of repositories can be changed
dynamically:

-   `@repos`: list all registered darcs repositories
-   `@repo-add path`: add a repository
-   `@repo-del path`: delete a repository

`path` must be an absolute path name. This means that only repositories
accessible over the local filesystem are supported.
