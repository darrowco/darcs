This is a page about darcsum-mode in Emacs.

# Getting Started

Download darcsum-mode from its repository at
<http://hub.darcs.net/simon/darcsum>.

## Installation and Loading

To use darcsum-mode, you must first download darcsum.el and put it
somewhere on your Emacs load path. Then load it into Emacs by running
`(require 'darcsum)`. You may want to load it from your Emacs
initialization file (`.emacs`)

## Viewing Changes

Once darcsum mode is loaded, run `M-x darcsum-whatsnew`. You will be
prompted for the directory in which to run, defaulting to your current
directory. Like darcs, you need only run on a directory that is in a
repository, not necessarily the repository root. If there are changes,
you will get a `*darcs*` buffer showing all of the changes in the
repository.

## Manipulating Patches

In order to perform operations on patches, you must select some patches.
darcsum-mode will operate on all patches that are showing if no patches
are selected.

If your cursor is on a patch, you can toggle the selection of a patch
with the m key.

To record the selected patches, use R.

As always, a good resource is `M-x describe-mode`.

# Problems

darcsum is not yet widely used, so there may be problems that have not
been discovered. Add them here.

Known issues (actually with a previous version, that may not apply to
the current one) include:

-   If you try to commit a patch which removes a directory, darcsum gets
    stuck (if you look at the " \*darcs record\*" buffer, you will see
    that darcs is asking whether the directory should be removed, and
    apparently darcsum doesn't provide an answer to that question).
-   If you have preferences in your `.darcs/defaults` that change the
    output of darcs, the parser may get confused. Specifically be
    careful of `ALL verbose`.
-   If there is an error (or other unexpected output) when recording,
    there is no feedback.
-   darcsum sometimes does nothing, and sometimes leaves cpu-hogging
    darcs processes running. This seems to happen more in large repos.
