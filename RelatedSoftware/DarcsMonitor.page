# darcs-monitor

[![flattr](http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png)](http://flattr.com/thing/60023/darcs-monitor)

Darcs-monitor will send email to a specified recipient about new changes
added to a specific darcs repository. It can be run as an apply posthook
(resulting in near-instantaneous “push” emails), or periodically from
Cron, or occasionally by hand, whatever seems most convenient.

## Downloads

The primary distribution site since 0.3.4 (May 2008) is
[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/darcs-monitor).
You can also get it by darcs at
[http://marcot.eti.br/darcs/darcs-monitor](http://marcot.eti.br/darcs/darcs-monitor)/
. It depends on mtl and [HaXml](HaXml) and is written in Haskell,
naturally. It has been tested only with GHC 6.8 so far. For installation
and usage instructions, refer to the README at any of the locations
above.

Please note that this software is very new and thus can be buggy. As
with any email-sending software, bugs can result in major annoyance;
user caution is warranted.
