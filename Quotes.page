# Darcs in the Git age

Why Darcs? Because it cooperates with you to do what you want, rather
than fighting with you to do what it wants like Git.

It's not merely that Darcs has a UI whereas Git doesn't; it's that Git
imposes a complex model of operation on you no matter what you are
trying to do. Darcs doesn't: there's a pristine tree and a working tree
and a set of patches, which you can move from one repository to another;
that's all.

Mercurial is your smart friend who likes to explain things to you. Git
is your genius coworker who sighs and rolls his eyes every time you ask
him a question. Darcs is your endomorphic cofunctor operating on a
Banach space...
