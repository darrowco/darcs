## EYK comments on [25 May draft][2012-05-25]

* Draft: [25 May][2012-05-25]
* Maybe you need some motivation on automatic update and these checks.
  Why is it something that you'd need to check?  What's the alternative
  to automatic update?  For example, you could maybe mention the
  possibility of the repo being updated by older non-pi darcs.
* isPatchIndexSync #2:

     - computing their hashes, whose hashes, the patches in the the patchset? Maybe a tad more formal?

* What is show patch-index-status for? Is it for debugging? Does it have
  some general use for darcs users?  Is it only for when something goes wrong?
* May be worth mentioning that these functions update the patch index files on disk

### Technical comments

* Automatic update: you may want to watch out for the undo commands like
  obliterate
* Automatic creation: what happens if you start using darcs-pi on a repository that
  was created by non-pi darcs, but which was not already obtained by darcs get (consider:
  user upgrades to darcs 2.10 and just starts using it on their pre-existing repos?)
