title: How Darcs interacts with SSH
...

TODO: this page is very out of date (darcs transfer-mode could be
described here in more detail, for example), but there are things in
here which may be useful for long term history-of-darcs knowledge (for
example, understanding our choices behind some SSH-related stuff).

# Notes from the Darcs 1 era

## Windows

1.0.9rc2 works fine with PuTTY on Windows XP *provided* that you use
public key authentication via pageant.

  command   uses       1.0.9rc2 putty pageant   1.0.9rc putty w/out pageant
  --------- ---------- ------------------------ -----------------------------
  get       scp,sftp   works                    
  push      scp,ssh    works                    
  pull      scp        works                    
  put       sftp,ssh   works                    
  send      scp        works                    works

## Unix

Note: the following results are for 1.0.9rc2, openssh 4.5 on MacOS X
(Intel)

  command   uses       --ssh-cm   --no-ssh-cm   sshagent   --no-ssh-cm, sshagent
  --------- ---------- ---------- ------------- ---------- -----------------------
  get       scp,sftp   works      works         works      works
  push      scp,ssh    works      works         works      works
  pull      scp        works      works         works      works
  put       sftp,ssh   works      works         works      works
  send      scp        works      NO! [1]       works      must fix

[1] --no-ssh-cm not supported (must fix)

## General notes

Running just the SSH tests

    cd tests
    USE_CONTROL_MASTER=1 REMOTE=you@foo.bar.info  ./ssh.sh

See also the SSH tester script in
[http://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/darcs-devel/2007-October/006392.html](http://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/darcs-devel/2007-October/006392.html)

-   Seems to be scp (or sftp) related in that if I replace it with just
    a generic program like ping, then everything goes fine

### PuTTY

Putty has this bad habit of using stdin/stdout for asking for passwords.
It's not a problem if you're using pageant. Note that Pagaent does not
appear to be available outside of windows, so no using darcs/PuTTY under
Unix! (then again, you have OpenSSH anyway, so why worry?)

What happens without pageant (Windows):

-   under 1.0.9rc2 - psftp (get) will continously ask you for your
    password and just die. This is because we are using stdin for
    batch-controlling psftp (this was added in 1.0.9rc2). This works
    fine when you are using PuTTY+pageant (no passwords to read), or if
    you are using OpenSSH (reads directly from the tty, not from
    stdin... cool!), but it breaks psftp sans pageant because it will
    try to read bits of batch file for the password
-   under 1.0.9rc2 - if you patch darcs to use the -b argument instead
    of feeding the batchfile in, darcs+PuTTY (sans pageant) just hangs
-   under 1.0.5 - you get the same hanging behaviour (whew! this means
    the hanging is not a regression that I introduced). No ideas yet
    what causes the hanging

PuTTY under Unix:

-   Interestingly, pscp continuously asks for passwords (pscp is called
    before psftp in darcs get) and then dies. Pscp is much better
    behaved in Windows, possibly because of how we have redirection set
    up, but then again psftp seems to get us on both platforms.

### Weird hanging

A user has reported subprocess hanging with 1.0.9rc2. He says it affects
large repositories only. The user is on MacIntel, and says that it's
highly reproducible. I wonder if it's just macs, or if there is a more
general problem.

2010-06: After much investigation, we eventually discovered (around
2007-10) that this was due to an OpenSSH bug. See
[issue437](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue437) for more details.

### darcs-ssh

We still have some unpleasant issues with darcs:

1.  creating the darcs-ssh in weird places (temp dir creation seems a
    little too loose to me; surely we can improve on it)
2.  not exiting the control master cleanly in all cases (if you Ctrl-C
    out of darcs, for example, you might have a loose cm process lying
    around)
3.  not cleaning up the darcs-ssh directory on exit (even a clean exit)

Is creating the directory in TEMPDIR neccesarily the best idea?
