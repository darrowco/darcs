# Overview

Conventions:

-   O(foo + bar) - likely most expensive first; but we include bar
    anyway because it's not systematic
-   fs - size of files in the pristine repository
-   fn - number of files in the pristine repository
-   ms, ns - size of patches in various repos
-   m, n - number patches in various repos

  lazy fetching   O(fs + fn)         fetch just the pristine files packs
  repo                               will bring this down to O(fs)

  fetching repo   O(ns + n + fs +    fetch each patch file separately too
                  fn)                packs will bring this down to O(ns +
                                     fs)

  getting ready                      TODO
  for darcs pull                     

  diffing working                    TODO
  and recorded                       

  basic merging   O(m n)             commute m patches on one side past n
  without                            on other [merging]
  conflicts                          

  minimal context O(n\^2)            given patches (X1..XN P), any X\_n
                                     patch you commute out has to go
                                     through X\_n+m that P depends on
                                     [min-context]

  conflicts                          TODO

# Notes

-   fetching: fs and ns matter because of time to copy a file, fn and n
    matter because of latency
-   min-context:
