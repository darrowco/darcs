Things in Darcs that are or that resemble hashes:

1.  Patch hash: hash of patch info (name, author name, timestamp, log, random seed)

    -   Used as an identifier for patches independently of their
        context (because patch internals change during commutation)
    -   Shown in the `darcs log` output
    -   This never changes, even if you commute the patch
    -   It changes if you amend the patch (the random seed is changed)

2.  File contents hash (sha256) - used for identifying/verifying hashed
    patch/pristine/inventory files

    -   For patches, it can change depending on what the context of the
        patch is, since it is a hash on patch info (which never changes
        unless patch is amended) + actual contents (which may change
        depending on context).
    -   All files of the recorded state (pristine) of a repository are
        hashed. In particular, the pristine hash is a hash of the
        entire recorded state of a repository. It can be found as the
        first line of `_darcs/hashed_inventory` (`pristine:...`).
    -   See [HashedPristine](HashedPristine) for details

3.  Patch bundle hash

    -   Found at the end of .dpatch files (`Patch bundle hash: ...`)
    -   Used to verify that patch bundle was not corrupted (eg. by a
        mail client)
    -   Darcs doesn't mind if you remove this.
    -   You probably should NOT remove it, but there are rare occasions
        where you might do so for [Forensics](/Forensics) or some sort
        of manual [rebase](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue938) operation.

4. Repository Weak Hash (since darcs 2.10.3)

    -   Shown in `darcs show repo` as `Weak Hash:`
    -   looks like a Patch Hash (1) and indeed is the XOR of all
        Patch Hashes of the repository
    -   the same set of patches produces the same repository weak
        hash, independently of their order
    -   not cryptographically secure (since patch hashes do not depend
        on patch contents)
