*Note: these directions correspond to a
[TracDarcs](RelatedSoftware/Trac) installation - you might need to
modify user names and directories to fit your system*

# Client-side

What we want is for the user to be able to do something like this:
`darcs clone http://bubba:stupidpassword@someserver.com/privateDarcs/someRepo`

(Whereas on the other hand
`darcs clone http://someserver.com/privateDarcs/someRepo` should fail)

# Server-side

## Creating the directory

1. Create a directory for all "private" darcs repositories:

           mkdir /var/privateDarcs
           chown root:darcs /var/privateDarcs

2. If you are using jailkit as described in TracOnDarcs:

           mv /var/privateDarcs /var/jail/var
           ln -s /var/jail/var/privateDarcs var

## Creating the password file

1. Create the passwords file:

           htpasswd -c /var/privateDarcs-passwords someUser

2. Add whatever users you want:

           htpasswd /var/privateDarcs-passwords someOtherUser

   Note: I personally like to have one user per repository or project.
   This is really weak protection anyway; more an extra layer
   of obscurity than anything else.

3. Set permissions on the file:

           chown www-data:www-data /var/privateDarcs-passwords
           chmod 640 /var/privateDarcs-passwords

## Apache Configuration

1. Add the following into your `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`:

           <Directory /var/privateDarcs/*>
             AuthType Basic
             AuthName "Private repository"
             AuthUserFile /var/privateDarcs-passwords
           </Directory\>

           # for each repository

           <Directory /var/privateDarcs/someRepository\>
             Require user bubba mary
           </Directory\>

           Alias /privateDarcs/ "/var/privateDarcs/"
