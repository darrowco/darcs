# Recommendations from Sprint 2010-03

Here is our list of recommendations. Any comments?

## Retain

-   --no-set-scripts-executable

    -   Detecting scripts is problematic [consider Windows].
    -   Setting permissions may have some kind of undesirable
        interaction with ACLs [not sure if I understood discussion]

## New defaults for Darcs 2.8

*this was left as an open question in 2010-03; we finally got around to it in 2012*

-   check --no-test

    -   add a darcs test command
    -   darcs trackdown to renamed to darcs test --linear

## New defaults for Darcs 2.5

-   pull/push/send --no-set-default

    -   ... but add an online reminder whenever you interact with a
        non-default repo about how to set the default

-   send --edit-description

-   record --no-test



## Undecided

The problem with the below is that it may interfere with scripts or
people using redirection on their shells. Our next step is to do
research on whether we can do reliable terminal detection on Windows
(already easy on \*nix) and then re-open the discussion.

-   apply --interactive
-   check --interactive

## Other notes

Salvatore pointed out that we should add some sort of mechanism for the
darcs command line to have a frozen behaviour (eg. for scripts). This
would let us change the command line UI at will, with scripts doing
something like DARCS\_BEHAVIOUR=frozen-2.5 darcs foo
