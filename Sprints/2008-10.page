# Agenda

During this first sprint, we shall be focusing our attention on the day
to day performance issues that darcs users commonly face.

This is what we are reaching for:

1.  Fast network operations. We want to make it very pleasant for users
    to darcs get a repository and pull some patches to it over http and
    ssh. Git does this very well, and we plan to learn from them.
2.  Cutting memory consumption. We want to profile the heck out of
    operations like darcs record, darcs convert and darcs whatsnew.
    What's eating up all the memory? And how can we can cut it down to
    size?
3.  Responsiveness. Sometimes basic darcs commands can take long enough
    for programmers to lose their train of thought. We want to track
    down these lost seconds and kill that dreaded context switch.
4.  Even better UI (lots of nice features to assign individually, for
    example, [issue75](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue75) and
    [issue126](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue126)) Of course, if you are
    interested in other areas, then you can work on those instead.

## What needs doing?

-   investigate:
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue390](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue390)
    whatsnew lstats every file (Reinier?)
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue80](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue80)
    record takes 2x memory (Jason and Don?)
-   performance regression suite
-   identify good 5 [StandardDarcsBenchmarks](StandardDarcsBenchmarks)
    that can be run on the buildbot, and add them to the repository
    (Eric)
-   integrate Ian's memory suite into darcs? (open!)
-   make it possible to view only the benchmarking results in buildbot
    (open!)
-   summarise benchmark results in buildbot (open!)
-   new performance features
-   on disk chunky hunk format (would be a new compatible repo format
    like old-fashioned vs hashed) (IanLynagh, [JasonDagit](JasonDagit),
    [DonStewart](DonStewart))
-   packs, as a network (latency) plus a responsivenes (less seeking of
    files) issue? (NicolasPouillard)
-   cache for darcs annotate (GaneshSittampalam,BenediktSchmidt)
-   poking at darcs
-   profile darcs for memory usage on
    [StandardDarcsBenchmarks](StandardDarcsBenchmarks) (needs fleshing
    out) (open!)
-   audit bytestring use in darcs (needs fleshing out) (open!)
-   all easy jobs
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue?@columns=title,id,activity,status,assignedto&@sort=activity&@group=priority&@filter=topic,status&@pagesize=50&@startwith=0&topic=6&status=-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7&@dispname=ProbablyEasy](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue?@columns=title,id,activity,status,assignedto&@sort=activity&@group=priority&@filter=topic,status&@pagesize=50&@startwith=0&topic=6&status=-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7&@dispname=ProbablyEasy)
-   very easy jobs
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue286](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue286)
    - dist --tag
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue545](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue545)
    - send --gpg-command

    - unpull messages
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue395](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue395)
    - record -m x (taken by Reinier!)
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue839](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue839)
-   less easy jobs
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue182](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue182)
    - show status command?
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue75](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue75)
    - \_darcs/trash
-   [http://bugs.darcs.net/issue126](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue126)
    -   splitting hunks (!)

### Other plans

-   tour of the darcs source (Nicolas and Jason)
-   early - it would be nice if we could help our new hackers, Gaetan
    and Reinier get up to speed with the darcs code
-   (talk about) iteratee/enumerator refactor? (JasonDagit and
    [DonStewart](DonStewart))
-   working on camp (IanLynagh)

## Hackers that need jobs

-   Reinier (thinking of issue 390)
-   Rob
-   Florent
-   Duncan
