  and patch choices code with help from Ganesh, Eric

- [what we need in ghc 7.10.3](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2015-September/009953.html)
  -> nothing it seems

## Saturday


- The manual status: in the old days of darcs, the documentation was present as LaTeX comments in the source code; that proved to be prone to users ignoring it. In the last iteration of darcs the manual was a HTML file generated from some introductory text and squashed together with the `darcs help` output. However, the manually handled part of the documentation got a bit out of date, and the darcs team decided to sack it with the release of 2.10. Now the documentation is present in the form of `darcs help markdown`, `darcs help patterns`, `darcs help environment` + the wiki.
- Dan takes a stab at viewing suspended patches in Darcsden
- Vinh gives comments about the website/wiki
- Guillaume digs more into select changes

## Sunday

- Guillaume deciding to have the NamedPatch to PatchInfo optimization into 2.10.2
- kicking off darcs.net's upgrade to current debian stable (ganesh and eric)
- Guillaume: porting Ale's last year get deps to HEAD
