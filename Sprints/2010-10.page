Our previous experience has been that the sprint has been useful for
designing stuff.

## Topics open

Time to be determined: meeting with some lab members about XML patches
and/or patch theory. Who's interested by what?

> -   Florent: both
> -   Eric: both

## SATURDAY

-   [Machine readable formats](../Ideas/MachineReadableFormats)
-   repo formats (eg. Camp) - Eric and Florent

    -   either new RM (Florent)
    -   or rotating RM
    -   or change approach
    -   FEATURE-BASED alphas!
    -   keep doing 6 monthly-type releases
    -   aim for Darcs 2.8 in March (hackathon convergance is OK)

    is going away? (Guillaume, Eric, Florent)
-   screened branch (everybody)

    trac-darcs, patch-tag, darcsden (Guillaume)

# Travel plans

Orléans is divided in two distant (10km) halves: the center-city and the
Source district. The campus is in the Source district. There is [one
hostel
there](http://www.auberges-de-jeunesse.com/en/auberges/france/centre/orleans),
just by the campus.

To come to Orléans, you have to take the train from Paris (1h), and stop
at either Les Aubrais Orléans or Orléans, then take the tram to
Université - Parc Floral to get to the campus.

## Shared hostel room

Who's interested in sharing a hostel room?

1.  Guillaume
2.  Reinier
