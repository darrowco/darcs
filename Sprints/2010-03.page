# Darcs hacking quick start

You'll have more fun if you can hit the ground running, so please make
sure you can do all of these things:

1.  darcs get --lazy [http://darcs.net](http://darcs.net)
2.  cabal configure; cabal build
3.  darcs send (your patch should wind up on the tracker)

    a.  create a test patch (see
        [http://darcs.net/report.html](http://darcs.net/report.html) )
    b.  see [Msmtp](/Msmtp) for easiest setup or configure your MTA if
        you know how
    c.  darcs send
    d.  wait 10 minutes
    e.  check the patch tracker
        [http://bugs.darcs.net](http://bugs.darcs.net) (Patches \> Show
        Open)

# Priorities

## ProbablyEasy

We'll meet a little before the sprint to pick out a top-N list of
candidates to work through. If we don't have many new hackers during the
sprint

## Target-2.5 Priorities

See [Roadmap]() for what's planned in Darcs 2.5.

We have to remember to focus on small achievable tasks here and not take
on things that are too large.

-   fix the O(n) record/etc problem:
    [issue1106](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1106) - Petr?
-   global cache: [issue1624](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1624) - Luca
    (hopefully)
-   filecache - Benedikt
-   new and improved darcs annotate -
    [issue25](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue25) (note this will be an
    especially nice one for Zurich because Johan Tibell will be there,
    plus Benedikt working on filecache) - Eric? (at least the easy bits)
-   cache cleanup - Reinier?
-   Windows installer
-   faster darcs get

# Talks and meetings

Our previous experience has been that the sprint has been useful for
designing stuff.

## FRIDAY

-   DONE: Ganesh and Benedikt
-   DONE: GSoC filechace
-   DONE: GSoC florent
-   DONE: release process

## SATURDAY

-   DONE: meeting? darcs rebase UI
-   DONE: global cache strategy

## SUNDAY

-   DONE - [../DefaultSwitches]() - lets get some decisions for Darcs
    2.5
-   DONE - consensus on hardcoded darcs paths? (kill them!)
-   NOT NEEDED? [hashed storage](/Development/DarcsHS)
-   DONE - [issue1645](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1645) (Petr has been
    duly nagged)
-   talk: Benedikt and Petr on their performance work
-   Roadmap bis
-   DONE Windows installer status

# Notes for the blog

## Friday lunch

-   We should have darcs optimize --http (eg. snapshots) - Petr
-   We should have a nice CGI script that makes darcs get over http fast
    - Petr
-   Let's call filecache something else. Current best candidate: patch
    index
-   Optimism about file-patch-map: maybe no GSoC project needed for
    that; do CGI instead?

## Friday evening

-   Ganesh and Petr - future handling of darcs conflicts - conflictor as
    graph
-   Ganesh and Petr - storing files in darcs repos
-   Petr, Ganesh and Eric - making darcs get faster

    -   smart cgi script
    -   (adapt darcs transfer-mode?)

-   Darcs optimize --http again

## Release process

-   We need people to test Darcs more
-   Reinier will do manual alphas on hackage every 4 weeks
-   Future work: automatic uploading? Tahoe-style supported/unsupported?

## Darcs rebase

Ganesh explained how darcs rebase worked and we all discussed a sensible
user interface for it

## global cache

Luca, Reinier and Petr discussed the global cache design. Their
conclusion was that we should store the bucketed cache and the old-style
cache in different directories. Every time you look up a file in the
cache:

> If the new-style cache exists:
>   ~ use that.
>
> Else:
>   ~ If the old-style cache exists:
>       ~ Create a new bucketed cache, hardlinked to the old-style one
>
>     Else:
>       ~ Create a new, empty bucketed cache
>
## DPM and Darcs Library

David, Stephen, Ganesh and Florent discussed an exciting new patch
management program for project maintainers. The DPM project offers a new
way of keeping track of incoming patch bundles; their status,
dependencies, reviews, etc. It's a pioneering user of the Darcs API.

We got a darcs apply --match feature out of this TODO: question about
conflicts?

## darcs diff --interactive

Florent, Ganesh and Eric discussed darcs diff -i, particularly the
question of what to do with patches that have been cherry-picked out of
the diff. Should they appear in the diff context (ie. go before) or not?
The current thinking is to include them so that users always see the
diff in the latest possible context.

## Windows installer

Salvatore put together a nice Windows installer using the [bamse
package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bamse). The only thing it
can't do is set the PATH for the user automatically. This will open the
door to nicer integration with Windows tools, for example, using
Tortoise SSH to avoid issue845

# Participants

# Travel plans

-   Eric Kow arrives at the airport 09:35 on the 19th; leaves at 21:55
    on the 21st
-   Ganesh Sittampalam arrives at the airport 12:40 on the 19th; leaves
    at 20:25 on the 21st (Swiss from LCY and back to LHR) (might try to
    get on the earlier flight arriving 11:20 if I get to airport in time
    and Swiss let me)
-   Petr Rockai arrives at Zurich HBF at 9:17 on the 19th and leaves at
    19:44 on the 21st
-   Guillaume Hoffmann arrives at Zurich HBF at 10:26 on the 19th and
    leaves at 17:02 on the 21st
-   Florent Becker arrives at HBF at 11:00 on the 19th and leaves at
    17:34 on the 21st.

## Shared hostel room

Who's interested in sharing a hostel room? Eric has booked 5 beds at the
[City Backpacker](http://www.city-backpacker.ch) (6 person room). The
hostel have been advised that we may be a larger group than that, likely
to use up the whole room. The beds go for 35 CHF per night + 3 CHF for
sheets. For two nights, that would work out to 80 CHF, or roughly 50
EUR.

One more bed available in the room!
