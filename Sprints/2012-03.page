Infrastructure/etc discussions:

-   GSoC 2012
-   GSoC after Haskell.org
-   Mission statement? “To build an easy to use version control system
    based on a theory of patches”

Technical discussions:

-   Petr's pathlib?
-   Packs
-   2.8
-   Local branches
-   Diff/newline stuff

# Discussion results

## Friday

-   Ganesh and Florent: discussing 2.8 release (what patches to grab
    from mainland)
-   Eric: cleaning up mailing lists, bts templates, discussing GSoC 2012
-   Aditya: discussing GSoC 2012, grokking matchers
-   Owen: thinking about conflictors

Report:

-   Eric: updates to mailing lists, BTS template and milestones, [GSoC
    2012](/GSoC/2012-PatchIndex), some light screening/reviewing
-   Aditya: how to bring patch-index into darcs changes, discussing
    proposal, studying matchers code and changes code
-   Ganesh: 2.8-release argh, charsets! Unicode, argh!
-   Florent: 2.8, PatchSelectChoices for real-time dependency feedback
    (interactive), and darcs diff interactive
-   Owen: invconflictor/duplicate
-   Ian: camp stuff, talking about filename encoding.
-   Simon (remote): irc commit bot, contributor setup troubleshooting,
    making utf8 shell test easier to run

## Saturday

Strategy discussion (hunker down, no “grand soir”)

- No more 5 yr Plan, No Big Push (cf. 2008 push for performance) - keep chipping away at the problem, cleaning things, making new features, eventually moving towards better
- Still we try to communicate our strategy/priorities.  The main emphasis these days is on [cleaning Darcs up](Development/Cleanup).
- Hosting is important to us.

    - Development of hosting+GUIs will be focusing on library code that makes that work better, though may include actually writing code that uses that library to prove it works
    - GUIs seen as a subset of hosting for now

- Emphasis on cleaning/reworking existing Darcs rather than any big bang wholesale replacements. Gradual progress.
- Darcs 3 aim mainly to get conflicts right.  Let's not hit that Second System effect
- GSoC 2013 mainly GUIs and Hosting (of course open to student suggestions)

Report:

* Aditya: presented patch index, implementation of changes w/ index
* Eric: patch774 and patch775, updated wiki to use markdown
* Florent
* Ganesh: Unicode progress!
* Ian: more proofs (eg. commute two patches: always same answer)
* Owen

# How: Darcs hacking quick start

You'll have more fun if you can hit the ground running, so please make
sure you can do all of these things:

1.  darcs get --lazy [http://darcs.net](http://darcs.net)
2.  cabal configure; cabal build
3.  darcs send (your patch should wind up on the tracker)

    a.  create a test patch (see
        [http://darcs.net/report.html](http://darcs.net/report.html) )
    b.  see [Msmtp](/Using/Send) for easiest setup or configure your MTA if
        you know how
    c.  darcs send
    d.  wait 10 minutes
    e.  check the patch tracker
        [http://bugs.darcs.net](http://bugs.darcs.net) (Patches \> Show
        Open)
