# What

## Irrelevant/wontfix/not for this sprint

  - <http://tinyurl.com/darcs-probablyeasy2> - easy bugs to solve

  - switch from test-framework to tasty

  - Darcs and [stack](www.haskellstack.org): add a stack file to darcs for the next releases
    - none of us want to do it right now

  - tentative-files-less darcs?
      - we need them. maybe we write them too much before doing the atomic swap?
      - nothing obvious to fix, let's not try anything

  - Darcs 2.10.3 and 2.12.0 with [GHC 8](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Status/GHC-8.0.1)
    - [GHC8 RC1](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2016-January/010966.html)
    - we don't have time for this this weekend and GHC 8's release is no longer imminent anyway

    * migrate darcs repos to hub.darcs.net ? see
      <http://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/darcs-devel/2015-March/016712.html>
        * things that should happen before: issue tracking (up to what's bugs.darcs.net is doing)
        * patch/bundle submission should happen before
            * there is old code for that (2 year old) that should be updated w/ email notifications (which we have now in darcsden)

## already addressed

  - [patch XOR](http://bugs.darcs.net/patch1414) as a repo state identifier
    - (we discussed about SSID)
    - Ga: we could make tags have a cryptographic hash inside of them?
    - accepted

  - [GSoC 2016](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)
    * organization application: Feb 8th to 19th
    * student application: March 14th to 25th
        * we would do the effort of participating only if someone we already know would participate as a student
        * we contacted dan

  * replace Patch/RealPatch names by something clearer?
    * we have to find new names.. they refer to Darcs1 and Darcs2 semantics
    * patch sent (new names ara RepoPatchV1/RepoPatchV2)

### Guillaume

  * user manual + developer handbook
    * user manual should be versioned in the darcs repository (more publicity, we don't have that many contributors)
    * so that when people submit patches, we nag them into updating the manual also
    * but it should be put online in some semantic url like darcs.net/manual/2.10/
    * developer handbook: let's write in on the wiki

### Ganesh

  - refactorings for 2.12:
    - Ganesh' stash refactorings?
        -  maybe not stash stash code but the underlying refactoring can go first

### Florent

  - interactive selection refactor/generalization for faster rollback with matching ?
    * florent: has an old branch for interactive diff

### All

  - [Pijul](https://pijul.org/)
