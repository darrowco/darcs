# Sprint backlog

# Friday

## morning


- correction for <http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1579> (dixie)
- Discussion: Where is the manual?
    - Guillaume removed it (with the website) from the repository (july 2012)
    - darcs.net/manual is the last generated version from the reviewed repository
    - darcs can generate a commands reference with `darcs help manpage`
      (Groff output) and `darcs help markdown` (markdown, can be given to pandoc to
      convert in many formats)
    - the motivation of moving away from literate haskell and latex is to have
      everything in markdown
    - what we should ensure: 1) darcs.net/manual has something 2) this something
      corresponds to the current stable branch of darcs (as of now 2.8), because
      sometimes commands and flags change
- Discussion: _darcs/inventories and _darcs/patches are not garbage collected


## afternoon

- accept patch that closes http://bugs.darcs.net/issue904 (gh)
- sent a patch to solve http://bugs.darcs.net/issue2274 (gh)
- fixing network test harness (gh)

# saturday

## morning

- Discussion: GSoC 2013 projects. We will apply as independent organization
  and ask for 2 slots. We have at least 3 posible projects.

## afternoon

- complete `darcs help markdown` so that it also outputs environment
  variables help and patterns help (dixie, gh)

# sunday

- Discussion: 2.10 release timeline:
    - we should have a beta by the time we apply as an organization for GSoC (ie, mid-March)
    - also it would be cool to have 2.10 on April 9th celebrate the 10 years of
      [the initial announcement of darcs](http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2003-April/004139.html) :-)
- Discussion: last regrets for 2.10:
    - conclusion is we keep it at is, but with some documentation, and add Return as an alias for Space to pick the default option at any prompt
    - some documentation being "did you know you can avoid the last question by pressing 'a' or 'd' when you're done?"
    - With future fixes as we find them, including: "Did you mean to record nothing?" if you've said n to each "do you want to record this?"
