We want to continue growing the list of people who have a solid
understanding of [PatchTheory](../Theory). Note that some of these
people hang out in \#darcs-theory on irc.freenode.net so do stop by for
a chat!

How to use this directory

-   Note that patch theory questions are best asked on the mailing list
    (darcs-users 2008-08).
-   Perhaps browse this list to have a better idea who is answering your
    question, or who you are debating with
-   Put yourself on this list

    -   ... even if you are just passively learning patch theory.
    -   ... if you want to formalise patch theory in a certain way
        (perhaps you can find a kindred spirit to work with)
    -   ... if you have a wacky patch theory idea (perhaps somebody else
        will have a similar wacky idea and you can collaborate!)

-   It would help if you put down a short explanation of the extent of
    your understanding.
-   Note that "last seen" refers to the last time we heard from them
    about patch theory

# Patch theorists

People who have actively been involved in the development of darcs patch
theory.

-   David Roundy

    -   David devised patch theory in the first place and probably
        understands the conflictors work in darcs 2 the best.
    -   last seen: 2008-08

-   [JasonDagit](../People/JasonDagit)

    -   Jason worked with David on the darcs 2 stuff. His master's
        thesis is on darcs. We are all looking forward to seeing it!

-   Ian Lynagh

    -   Ian has participated in many of the core patch theory
        discussions. He has also started the
        [Camp](http://projects.haskell.org/camp/) project, to develop
        and prove correct a darcs-like theory that will hopefully form
        the basis for darcs 3.

-   [GaneshSittampalam](../People/GaneshSittampalam)

    -   Ganesh was working on conflictors up to 2005/2006. Along with
        Arjan, he figures as a character in the wikibook.
    -   also worked on: [GaneshPatchAlgebra](GaneshPatchAlgebra)
    -   gaps: Ganesh said he doesn't really understand what's going on
        recently (say in darcs 2)
    -   last seen: 2006

-   Arjan Boeijink

    -   Arjan was working on conflictors up to 2005/2006, if I recall
        correctly. He has recently resurfaced. Welcome back!

-   [Jean-Phillipe Bernardy](People/JeanPhillipeBernardy)

    -   Jean-Phillipe\_ and students were working on an alternative
        patch theory in which conflicts do not exist. Instead, an
        internal representation of repository state is chosen to
        accomodate conflicting states.
    -   "A patch theory should be divided in two parts... an internal
        representation for data... [and] a relation between internal and
        external representation" (see [FoCAL](../FoCAL) for details)
    -   last seen: 2009-01

-   Judah Jacobson

    -   Judah wrote up a formalisation of patch theory using inverse
        semigroups...

# Alternative patch theorists

I don't like making distinctions here, but I guess it is useful to have
a list of people who have suggested reformulations of patch theory, or
patch theory as it is not (currently) used by darcs

-   [MarnixKlooster](../People/MarnixKlooster)

    -   Marnix developed [a patch
        calculus](http://home.solcon.nl/mklooster/darcs/patch-calculus.html)

-   [PekkaPessi](../People/PekkaPessi)

    -   Pekka started working on [Pekka patch
        theory](PekkaPatchTheory)...
    -   last seen: 2007

-   Will Uther - has looked into the relationship between patch theory
    and operational transforms

    -   [operational transformation on revctrl
        wiki](http://revctrl.org/OperationalTransformation)
    -   last seen: 2009-09

# Patch theory students

-   [Eric Kow](../People/EricKow)

    -   Eric (with Arjan's guidance) wrote the introductory chapter on
        the understanding darcs wikibook, so he has a rudimentary
        understanding of patch theory without conflicts (i.e. he knows
        what commutation is and how darcs uses it).
    -   gaps: He doesn't have a clue what goes on after there, nor does
        he really get any of the new properties like permutivity
    -   last seen: 2007

-   [Petr Rockai](../People/PetrRockai)

    -   last seen: 2008-08

-   Apfelmus

    -   Interested bystander who likes mathematical correctness and
        proofs.
    -   last seen: 2009-10

-   [Reinier Lamers](../People/ReinierLamers)

    -   Thinks he should understand patch theory as a darcs coder
