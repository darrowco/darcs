This is a page for discussing and recording various permutivity
scenarios. If you aren't familiar with the new conflictor work (and most
people aren't), you probably won't benefit much from reading this page.

In particular, this will let you see how conflictors really ought to
look.

My latest idea for conflictor notation consists of three conflictor
forms, a "left-conflict" a "right-conflict" and a "middle-conflict". An
ordinary conflicting commute of two primitive patches leads to a left
and right conflict:

    AB <-> <A;@B| |@A;B>

The "@B" portion of the conflictor indicates the identity of the
patch---A is now on the right, and B on the left. The conflictor <A;@B|
is a left-conflictor, which is why it points to the left. The "A" part
of this is the effect of this conflictor. The right-conflictor is
symmetric with the left-conflictor. Together, left and right conflictors
are referred to as \\emph{ordinary conflictors}. There are a couple more
fields in an ordinary conflictor, but I won't discuss them quite yet. To
the conflictor experts they'll be easy to guess.

The third sort of conflictor is the "middle-conflict", which is written
as |(A);@B;(C)|. Its identity is B, and conflicts with patches on both
the right and the left. Its effect is B\^.

# Three parallel conflicting patches

Here we have `A \/ B \/ C`. Note that the symmetry between `B` and `C`
leads to a sort of "top-bottom" symmetry in the permutations. And even
the symmetry between `A^` and `C` is apparent in the middle scenario.

    A^        B            <B^;@C|

# Permutation of four noncommuting patches

This is just a sketch, feel free to add in more. I'm using the notation
{a[BC]} to mean "the patch A, which has effect BC". Feel free to adjust
the notation.

    a  b  c  d = a[A]    b[B]   c[C]   d[D]
    b1 a1 c  d = b[A]    a[B]   c[C]   d[D]
    b1 c1 a2 d = b[A]    c[]    a[BC]  d[D]
    c2 b2 a2 d = c[AB]   b[B^]  a[BC]  d[D]
    c2 a3 b3 d = c[AB]   a[]    b[C]   d[D]
    a  c3 b3 d = a[A]    c[B]   b[C]   d[D]
    (so far it's just the three-way commute, and we can copy stuff over from above)

    a  b  d4 c4 = a[A]   b[B]   d[C]   c[D]
    a  d5 b4 c4
    a  d5 c5 b5
    a  c3 d3 b5
    a  c3 b3 d
    (again, it's trivial stuff)

    d6 a4 b4 c4 = d[ABC] a[]    b[]    c[D]
    d6 b6 a5 c4 = d[ABC] b[?]   a[?]   c[D]
    d6 b6 c6 a6 = d[ABC] b[C^]  c[B^]  a[BCD] ?
    d6 c7 b7 a6 = d[ABC] c[C^]  b[B^]  a[BCD] ??

    b1 a1 d4 c4 = b[A]   a[B]   d[C]   c[D]
    b1 a1 c  d  = b[A]   a[B]   c[C]   c[D]
    b1 d7 a7 c4 = b[A]   d[B]?  a[C]?  c[D]  ???

    (I haven't covered all the permutations, but that's enough for now)
