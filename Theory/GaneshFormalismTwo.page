[An attempt at some formalisation, and a nearly finished proof of n-way
permutivity](http://urchin.earth.li/darcs/ganesh/darcs-patch-theory/theory/formal.pdf)

Ganesh notes:

A vague memory of a chat with Andres Loeh: He pointed me at (I think)
group presentations; the fact that S\_n has a group presentation in
terms of a set of generators that are adjacent transpositions nearly
gives us the n-way permutivity proof (TODO: reconstruct the reasoning).
However that doesn't take account of the fact that in patch theory some
transpositions may be illegal (commute failure). It bears further
investigation though. I was recently reminded of this by reading
